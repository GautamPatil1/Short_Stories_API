                "content": "\nFor the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle\u2014a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\nAt the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years\u2019 standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\nThat Friday, their son\u2019s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\nOutside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\nDuring the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers\u2014a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails\u2014was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks\u2014in Minsk, years ago.\nThe last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor\u2019s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\nThe system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. \u201cReferential mania,\u201d the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\nWhen they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\nIn silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\nWhen he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fianc\u00e9 fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six\u2014that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten\u2014the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\nAll this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\nIt was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you sleep?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou were so tired.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep because I am dying,\u201d he said, and lay down on the couch.\n\u201cIs it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?\u201d\n\u201cNo doctors, no doctors,\u201d he moaned. \u201cTo the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be responsible.... Responsible!\u201d He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe will bring him home tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\u201cI would like some tea,\u201d said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\nBending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor\u2014the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, \u201cI have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won\u2019t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.\u201d\nThe telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\n\u201dCan I speak to Charlie?\u201d a girl\u2019s dull little voice said to her now.\n\u201cWhat number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.\u201d\nShe put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. \u201cIt frightened me,\u201d she said.\nHe smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\nThe telephone rang a second time.\nThe same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.\n\u201cYou have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter \u2018o\u2019 instead of the zero.\u201d She hung up again.\nThey sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and re\u00ebxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels\u2014apricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to crab apple when the telephone rang again.\n"

Will it\nhappen today, will it ?\"\n\"Look, look; see for yourself !\"\nThe children pressed to each other like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.\nIt rained.\nIt had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with rain, with the drum and gush of water, with the sweet crystal fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand times to be crushed again. And this was the way life was forever on the planet Venus, and this was the schoolroom of the children of the rocket men and women who had come to a raining world to set up civilization and live out their lives.\n\"It\u2019s stopping, it\u2019s stopping !\"\n\"Yes, yes !\"\nMargot stood apart from them, from these children who could ever remember a time when there wasn\u2019t rain and rain and rain. They were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when the sun came out for an hour and showed its face to the stunned world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night, she heard them stir, in remembrance, and she knew they were dreaming and remembering gold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with. She knew they thought they remembered a warmness, like a blushing in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands. But then they always\nawoke to the tatting drum, the endless shaking down of clear bead necklaces upon the roof, the walk, the gardens, the forests, and their dreams were gone.\nAll day yesterday they had read in class about the sun. About how like a lemon it was, and how hot. And they had written small stories or essays or poems about it: \"I think the sun is a flower,That blooms for just one hour.\" That was Margot\u2019s poem, read in a quiet voice in the still classroom while the rain was falling outside.\n\"Aw, you didn\u2019t write that!\" protested one of the boys.\n\"I did,\" said Margot. \"I did.\"\n\"William!\" said the teacher.\nBut that was yesterday. Now the rain was slackening, and the children were crushed in the great thick windows.\n\"Where\u2019s teacher ?\"\n\"She\u2019ll be back.\"\n\"She\u2019d better hurry, we\u2019ll miss it !\"\nThey turned on themselves, like a feverish wheel, all tumbling spokes. Margot stood alone. She was a very frail girl who looked as if she had been lost in the rain for years and the rain had washed out the blue from her eyes and the red from her mouth and the yellow from her hair. She was an old photograph dusted from an album, whitened away, and if she spoke at all her voice would be a ghost. Now she stood, separate, staring at the rain and the loud wet world beyond the huge glass.\n\"What\u2019re you looking at ?\" said William.\nMargot said nothing.\n\"Speak when you\u2019re spoken to.\"\nHe gave her a shove. But she did not move; rather she let herself be moved only by him and nothing else. They edged away from her, they would not look at her. She felt them go away. And this was because she would play no games with them in the echoing tunnels of the underground city. If they tagged her and ran, she stood blinking after them and did not follow. When the class sang songs about happiness and life and games her lips barely moved. Only when they sang about the sun and the summer did her lips move as she watched the drenched windows. And then, of course, the biggest crime of all was that she had come here only five years ago from Earth, and she remembered the sun and the way the sun was and the sky was when she was four in Ohio. And they, they had been on Venus all their lives, and they had been only two years old when last the sun came out and had long since forgotten the color and heat of it and the way it really was.\nBut Margot remembered.\n\"It\u2019s like a penny,\" she said once, eyes closed.\n\"No it\u2019s not!\" the children cried.\n\"It\u2019s like a fire,\" she said, \"in the stove.\"\n\"You\u2019re lying, you don\u2019t remember !\" cried the children.\nBut she remembered and stood quietly apart from all of them and watched the patterning windows. And once, a month ago, she had refused to shower in the school shower rooms, had clutched her hands to her ears and over her head, screaming the water mustn\u2019t touch her head. So after that, dimly, dimly, she sensed it, she was different and they knew her difference and kept away. There was talk that her father and mother were taking her back to Earth next year; it seemed vital to her that they do so, though it would mean the loss of thousands of dollars to her family. And so, the children hated her for all these reasons of big and little consequence. They hated her pale snow face, her waiting silence, her thinness, and her possible future.\n\"Get away !\" The boy gave her another push. \"What\u2019re you waiting for?\"\nThen, for the first time, she turned and looked at him. And what she was waiting for was in her eyes.\n\"Well, don\u2019t wait around here !\" cried the boy savagely. \"You won\u2019t see nothing!\"\nHer lips moved.\n\"Nothing !\" he cried. \"It was all a joke, wasn\u2019t it?\" He turned to the other children. \"Nothing\u2019s happening today. Is it ?\"\nThey all blinked at him and then, understanding, laughed and shook their heads.\n\"Nothing, nothing !\"\n\"Oh, but,\" Margot whispered, her eyes helpless. \"But this is the day, the scientists predict, they say, they know, the sun\u2026\"\n\"All a joke !\" said the boy, and seized her roughly. \"Hey, everyone, let\u2019s put her in a closet before the teacher comes !\"\n\"No,\" said Margot, falling back.\nThey surged about her, caught her up and bore her, protesting, and then pleading, and then crying, back into a tunnel, a room, a closet, where they slammed and locked the door. They stood looking at the door and saw it tremble from her beating and throwing herself against it. They heard her muffled cries. Then, smiling, the turned and went out and back down the tunnel, just as the teacher arrived.\n\"Ready, children ?\" She glanced at her watch.\n\"Yes !\" said everyone.\n\"Are we all here ?\"\n\"Yes !\"\nThe rain slacked still more.They crowded to the huge door.\nThe rain stopped.\nIt was as if, in the midst of a film concerning an avalanche, a tornado, a hurricane, a volcanic eruption, something had, first, gone wrong with the sound apparatus, thus muffling and finally cutting off all noise, all of the blasts and repercussions and thunders, and then, second, ripped the film from the projector and inserted in its place a beautiful tropical slide which did not move or tremor. The world ground to a standstill. The silence was so immense and unbelievable that you felt your ears had been stuffed or you had lost your hearing altogether. The children put their hands to their ears. They stood apart. The door slid back and the smell of the silent, waiting world came in to them.\nThe sun came out.\nIt was the color of flaming bronze and it was very large. And the sky around it was a blazing blue tile color. And the jungle burned\nwith sunlight as the children, released from their spell, rushed out, yelling into the springtime.\n\"Now, don\u2019t go too far,\" called the teacher after them. \"You\u2019ve only two hours, you know. You wouldn\u2019t want to get caught out !\"\nBut they were running and turning their faces up to the sky and feeling the sun on their cheeks like a warm iron; they were\ntaking off their jackets and letting the sun burn their arms.\n\"Oh, it\u2019s better than the sun lamps, isn\u2019t it?\"\n\"Much, much better !\"\nThey stopped running and stood in the great jungle that covered Venus, that grew and never stopped growing, tumultuously, even as you watched it. It was a nest of octopi, clustering up great arms of fleshlike weed, wavering, flowering in this brief spring. It was the color of rubber and ash, this jungle, from the many years without sun. It was the color of stones and white cheeses and ink, and it was the color of the moon.\nThe children lay out, laughing, on the jungle mattress, and heard it sigh and squeak under them resilient and alive. They ran among the trees, they slipped and fell, they pushed each other, they played hideand-seek and tag, but most of all they squinted at the sun until the tears ran down their faces; they put their hands up to that yellowness and that amazing blueness and they breathed of the fresh, fresh air and listened and listened to the silence which\nsuspended them in a blessed sea of no sound and no motion. They looked at everything and savored everything. Then, wildly, like animals escaped from their caves, they ran and ran in shouting circles. They ran for an hour and did not stop running.\nAnd then -\nIn the midst of their running one of the girls wailed.\nEveryone stopped.\nThe girl, standing in the open, held out her hand.\n\"Oh, look, look,\" she said, trembling.\nThey came slowly to look at her opened palm.\nIn the center of it, cupped and huge, was a single raindrop. She began to cry, looking at it. They glanced quietly at the sun.\n\"Oh. Oh.\"\nA few cold drops fell on their noses and their cheeks and their mouths. The sun faded behind a stir of mist. A wind blew cold around them. They turned and started to walk back toward the underground house, their hands at their sides, their smiles\nvanishing away.\nA boom of thunder startled them and like leaves before a new hurricane, they tumbled upon each other and ran. Lightning struck\nten miles away, five miles away, a mile, a half mile. The sky darkened into midnight in a flash.\nThey stood in the doorway of the underground for a moment until it was raining hard. Then they closed the door and heard the gigantic sound of the rain falling in tons and avalanches, everywhere and forever.\n\"Will it be seven more years ?\"\n\"Yes. Seven.\"\nThen one of them gave a little cry.\n\"Margot !\"\n\"What ?\"\n\"She\u2019s still in the closet where we locked her.\"\n\"Margot.\"\nThey stood as if someone had driven them, like so many stakes, into the floor. They looked at each other and then looked away. They glanced out at the world that was raining now and raining and raining steadily. They could not meet each other\u2019s glances. Their faces were solemn and pale. They looked at their hands and feet, their faces down.\n\"Margot.\"\nOne of the girls said, \"Well\u2026 ?\"\nNo one moved.\n\"Go on,\" whispered the girl.\nThey walked slowly down the hall in the sound of cold rain. They turned through the doorway to the room in the sound of the storm and thunder, lightning on their faces, blue and terrible. They walked over to the closet door slowly and stood by it. Behind the closet door was only silence. They unlocked the door, even more\nslowly, and let Margot out.\n"

Nervously he pressed a coin into the palm of one hand.\n\"Just start anywhere,\" I said, \"and tell me all about it.\"\n\"As before?\" Without waiting for an answer, he continued, the coin clutched tightly in one hand. \"I'm Charles J. Fisher, professor of Philosophy at Reiser College.\"\nHe looked at me quickly. \"Or at least I was until recently.\" For a second his face was boyish. \"Professor of Philosophy, that is.\"\nI smiled and found that I was staring at the coin in his hand. He gave it to me. On one side I read the words: THE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COIN IS FALSE. The patient watched me with an expressionless face; I turned over the coin. It was engraved with the words: THE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COIN IS FALSE.\n\"That's not the problem,\" he said, \"not my problem. I had the coin made when I was an undergraduate. I enjoyed reading one side, turning it over, reading the other side, and so on. A fiendish enjoyment like boys planning where to put the tipped-over outhouse.\"\nI looked at the patient. He was thirty-eight, single, medium build, had an M.A. and Ph.D. from an eastern university. I knew this and more from the folder on my desk.\n\"Eight months ago,\" he continued, \"I read about the sphere found on Paney Island.\" He stopped, looking at me questioningly.\n\"Yes, I know,\" I said. I opened my desk drawer, took out a clipping from the newspaper, and handed it to him.\n\"That's it.\"\nI read the clipping before putting it back in the drawer.\nManila, Sept. 24 (INS) Archeologists from University of California have discovered in earth fault of recent quake a sphere two feet in diameter of an unidentifiable material.\nDr. Karl Schwartz, head of the group, said the sphere was returned to the University for study. He declined to answer questions on the cultural origin of the sphere.\n\"There wasn't any more in the newspapers about it,\" he said. \"I have a friend in California who got me the photographs.\"\nHe looked at me intently. \"You won't believe any of this.\" He pressed the coin into the palm of his hand. \"You won't be able to.\"\n\"The photographs,\" he continued, as if lecturing, \"were of characters projected by the sphere when placed before a focused light. The sphere was transparent, you see, imbedded with dark microscopic specks. By moving the sphere a certain distance each time, there was a total projection of three hundred and sixty different characters in eighteen different orderings. Or nineteen different orderings if you count one which was a list of all the characters.\"\nI made a mental note of the numbers. I felt they were significant.\n\"As I said,\" he continued, \"I obtained the photographs of the characters. Very strange shapes, totally unlike the characters of Oriental languages, but yet that is the closest way to describe them.\" He jerked forward in his chair, \"Except, of course, ostensively.\"\n\"Later,\" I said. I wanted to get through the preliminaries first. There would be time later to see the photographs.\n\"The characters projected by the sphere,\" he said, \"weren't like the characters of any known language.\" He paused dramatically. \"There was reason to believe they had origin in an unknown culture. A culture more scientifically advanced than our own.\"\n\"And the reasons for this supposition?\" I asked.\n\"The material ... the material of the sphere. It could only be roughly classified as ferro-plastic. Totally unknown, amazing imperviousness. A synthetic material, hardly the product of a former culture.\"\n\"From Mars?\" I said, smiling.\n\"There were all kinds of conjectures, but, of course, the important thing was to see if the projection of characters was a message. The message, if any, would mean more than any conjecture.\"\n\"You translated it?\"\nHe polished the coin on his jacket. \"You won't dare believe it,\" he said sharply.\nHe cleared his throat and stiffened into a more rigid posture. \"It wasn't exactly translation. You see, to us none of the characters had designation. They were just characters.\"\n\"So it was a problem of decoding?\" I asked.\n\"As it turned out, no. Decoding is dependent on knowledge of language characteristics\u2014characteristics of known languages. Decoding was tried, but without success. No, what we had to find was a key to the language.\"\n\"You mean like the Rune Stone?\"\n\"More or less. In principle, we needed a picture of a cow, and a sign of meaning indicating one of the characters.\n\"For me, there was no possibility of finding similarities between the characters and characters of other languages\u2014that would require tremendous linguistic knowledge and library facilities. Nor could I use a decoding approach\u2014that would require special knowledge of techniques and access to electronic computers and other mechanical aids. No, I had to work on the assumption that the key to the sphere was implicit in the sphere.\"\n\"You hoped to find the key to the language in the language itself?\"\n\"Exactly. You know, of course, some languages do have an implicit key? For example hieroglyphics or picture language. The word for cow is a picture of a cow.\"\nHe looked at the toes of his shoes. \"You won't be able to believe it. It's impossible to believe. I use the word impossible in its logical sense.\n\"In most languages,\" he continued, looking up from his shoes, \"the sound of some words themselves indicates the meaning of the word. Onomatopoetic words like bowwow, buzz.\"\n\"And the key to the unknown language?\" I asked. \"How did you find it?\"\nI watched him push the coin against the back of his arm, then lift it to read the backward letters pressed into his skin. He looked up at me and smiled.\n\"I built models of the characters. Big material ones, exactly proportionate to the ones projected. Then\u2014quite by accident\u2014I viewed one of them through a glass globe the size of the original sphere. What do you think I saw?\"\n\"What?\" I noticed he had the boyish look again.\n\"A distortion of the model. But that's not what's important. The distortions, on study, gave specific visual entities. Like when looking at one of those trick pictures and suddenly seeing the lion in the grass. The lines outlining the lion are there all the time, only the observer has to view them as the outline of a lion. It was the same with the models of the characters, except the shapes that appeared were not of lions or other recognizable things. But they did suggest.\"\nHe pressed the coin against his forehead, closed his eyes and appeared to be thinking deeply. \"Yes, impossible to believe. No one can believe it.\"\n\"In addition to the visual response, the distortions gave me definite feelings. Not mixtures of feelings, but one definite emotional experience.\"\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\"One character when viewed through the globe gave me a visual image and, at the same time, a strong feeling of light hilarity.\"\n\"I take it then that these distortions seemed to connote meanings, rather than denote them. You might say that their meaning was conveyed through a Gestalt experience on the part of the observer.\"\n\"Yes, each character gave a definite Gestalt. But, the Gestalt was the same for each observer. Or at least for thirty-five observers there was an eighty per cent correlation.\"\nI whistled softly. \"And the translation?\"\n\"Doctor, what would you say if I told you the translation was unbelievable; that it couldn't be seriously entertained by any man? What if I said that it would take the sanity of any man who believed it?\"\n\"I would say that it might well be incorrect.\"\nHe took some papers from his pocket and laughed excitedly, slumping down in the chair. \"This is the complete translation in idiomatic English. I'm going to let you read it, but first I want you to consider a few things.\"\nHe hid the papers behind the back of his chair; his face became even more boyish, almost as if he were deciding on where to put the tipped over outhouse.\n\"Consider first, doctor, that there was a total projection of three hundred and sixty different characters. The same number as the number of degrees in a circle. Consider also that there were eighteen different orderings of the characters, or nineteen counting the alphabetical list. The square root of three hundred and sixty would lie between eighteen and nineteen.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. I remembered there was something significant about the numbers, but I wasn't at all sure that it was this.\n\"Consider also,\" he continued, \"that the communication was through the medium of a sphere. Moreover, keep in mind that physics accepts the path of a beam of light as its definition of a straight line. Yet, the path is a curve; if extended sufficiently it would be a circle, the section of a sphere.\"\n\"All right,\" I said. By now the patient was pounding the coin against the sole of one shoe.\n\"And,\" he said, \"keep in mind that in some sense time can be thought of as another dimension.\" He suddenly thrust the papers at me and sat back in the chair.\nI picked up the translation and began reading. The patient sat stiffly in the leather chair on the other side of the desk. Nervously he pressed a coin into the palm of one hand.\n\"Just start anywhere,\" I said, \"and tell me all about it.\"\n\"As before?\" Without waiting for an answer, he continued, the coin clutched tightly in one hand. \"I'm Charles J. Fisher, professor of philosophy at Reiser College.\"\nHe looked at me quickly. \"Or at least I was until recently.\" For a second his face was boyish. \"Professor of philosophy, that is.\"\nI smiled and found that I was staring at the coin in his hand. He gave it to me. On one side I read the words: THE STATEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COIN IS FALSE. The patient watched.... \n"

Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking\nthan anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the\n211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the\nUnited States Handicapper General.\nSome things about living still weren\u2019t quite right, though. April, for instance, still drove people crazy by\nnot being springtime. And it was in that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel\nBergeron\u2019s fourteen-year-old son, Harrison, away.\nIt was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn\u2019t think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly\naverage intelligence, which meant she couldn\u2019t think about anything except in short bursts. And George,\nwhile his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required\nby law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the\ntransmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of\ntheir brains.\nGeorge and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel\u2019s cheeks, but she\u2019d forgotten for\nthe moment what they were about.\nOn the television screen were ballerinas.\nA buzzer sounded in George\u2019s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits from a burglar alarm.\n\u201cThat was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said George.\n\u201cThat dance \u2013 it was nice,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cYup,\u201d said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They weren\u2019t really very good \u2013 no\nbetter than anybody else would have been, anyway. They were burdened with sashweights and bags of\nbirdshot, and their faces were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face,\nwould feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague notion that maybe dancers\nshouldn\u2019t be handicapped. But he didn\u2019t get very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered\nhis thoughts.\nGeorge winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas.\nHazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself she had to ask George what the latest sound had\nbeen.\n\u201cSounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer,\u201d said George.\n\u201cI\u2019d think it would be real interesting, hearing all the different sounds,\u201d said Hazel, a little envious. \u201cAll the\nthings they think up.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d said George.\n\u201cOnly, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I would do?\u201d said Hazel. Hazel, as a matter of fact,\nbore a strong resemblance to the Handicapper General, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. \u201cIf I was\nDiana Moon Glampers,\u201d said Hazel, \u201cI\u2019d have chimes on Sunday \u2013 just chimes. Kind of in honor of\nreligion.\u201d\n\u201cI could think, if it was just chimes,\u201d said George.\n\u201cWell \u2013 maybe make \u2018em real loud,\u201d said Hazel. \u201cI think I\u2019d make a good Handicapper General.\u201d\n\u201cGood as anybody else,\u201d said George.\n\u201cWho knows better\u2019n I do what normal is?\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cRight,\u201d said George. He began to think glimmeringly about his abnormal son who was now in jail, about\nHarrison, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his head stopped that.\n\u201cBoy!\u201d said Hazel, \u201cthat was a doozy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIt was such a doozy that George was white and trembling and tears stood on the rims of his red eyes. Two\nof the eight ballerinas had collapsed to the studio floor, were holding their temples.\n\u201cAll of a sudden you look so tired,\u201d said Hazel. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stretch out on the sofa, so\u2019s you can rest\nyour handicap bag on the pillows, honeybunch.\u201d She was referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in\ncanvas bag, which was padlocked around George\u2019s neck. \u201cGo on and rest the bag for a little while,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not equal to me for a while.\u201d\nGeorge weighed the bag with his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t notice it any more. It\u2019s just a\npart of me.\n\u201cYou been so tired lately \u2013 kind of wore out,\u201d said Hazel. \u201cIf there was just some way we could make a\nlittle hole in the bottom of the bag, and just take out a few of them lead balls. Just a few.\u201d\n\u201cTwo years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took out,\u201d said George. \u201cI don\u2019t call that\na bargain.\u201d\n\u201cIf you could just take a few out when you came home from work,\u201d said Hazel. \u201cI mean \u2013 you don\u2019t\ncompete with anybody around here. You just set around.\u201d\n\u201cIf I tried to get away with it,\u201d said George, \u201cthen other people\u2019d get away with it and pretty soon we\u2019d be\nright back to the dark ages again, with everybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn\u2019t like\nthat, would you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d hate it,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said George. \u201cThe minute people start cheating on laws, what do you think happens to\nsociety?\u201d\nIf Hazel hadn\u2019t been able to come up with an answer to this question, George couldn\u2019t have supplied one.\nA siren was going off in his head.\n\u201cReckon it\u2019d fall all apart,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cWhat would?\u201d said George blankly.\n\u201cSociety,\u201d said Hazel uncertainly. \u201cWasn\u2019t that what you just said?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d said George.\nThe television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn\u2019t clear at first as to what the\nbulletin was about, since the announcer, like all announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about\nhalf a minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, \u201cLadies and gentlemen \u2013 \u201d\nHe finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina to read.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right \u2013\u201d Hazel said of the announcer, \u201che tried. That\u2019s the big thing. He tried to do the best he\ncould with what God gave him. He should get a nice raise for trying so hard.\u201d\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen\u201d said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She must have been extraordinarily\nbeautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous. And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and\nmost graceful of all the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred-pound\nmen.\nAnd she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voice for a woman to use. Her\nvoice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. \u201cExcuse me \u2013 \u201d she said, and she began again, making her\nvoice absolutely uncompetitive.\n\u201cHarrison Bergeron, age fourteen,\u201d she said in a grackle squawk, \u201chas just escaped from jail, where he\nwas held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under\u2013\nhandicapped, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous.\u201d\nA police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen \u2013 upside down, then sideways, upside\ndown again, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background\ncalibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall.\nThe rest of Harrison\u2019s appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever worn heavier\nhandicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H\u2013G men could think them up. Instead of a little\near radio for a mental handicap, he wore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy\nlenses. The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give him whanging\nheadaches besides.\nScrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry, a military neatness to the\nhandicaps issued to strong people, but Harrison looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life,\nHarrison carried three hundred pounds.\nAnd to offset his good looks, the H\u2013G men required that he wear at all times a red rubber ball for a nose,\nkeep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his even white teeth with black caps at snaggle\u2013tooth random.\n\u201cIf you see this boy,\u201d said the ballerina, \u201cdo not \u2013 I repeat, do not \u2013 try to reason with him.\u201d\nThere was the shriek of a door being torn from its hinges.\nScreams and barking cries of consternation came from the television set. The photograph of Harrison\nBergeron on the screen jumped again and again, as though dancing to the tune of an earthquake.\nGeorge Bergeron correctly identified the earthquake, and well he might have \u2013 for many was the time his\nown home had danced to the same crashing tune. \u201cMy God \u2013\u201d said George, \u201cthat must be Harrison!\u201d\nThe realization was blasted from his mind instantly by the sound of an automobile collision in his head.\nWhen George could open his eyes again, the photograph of Harrison was gone. A living, breathing\nHarrison filled the screen.\nClanking, clownish, and huge, Harrison stood in the center of the studio.The knob of the uprooted studio\ndoor was still in his hand. Ballerinas, technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees\nbefore him, expecting to die.\n\u201cI am the Emperor!\u201d cried Harrison. \u201cDo you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at\nonce!\u201d He stamped his foot and the studio shook.\n\u201cEven as I stand here \u2013\u201d he bellowed, \u201ccrippled, hobbled, sickened \u2013 I am a greater ruler than any man\nwho ever lived! Now watch me become what I can become!\u201d\nHarrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper, tore straps guaranteed to support\nfive thousand pounds.\nHarrison\u2019s scrap\u2013iron handicaps crashed to the floor.\nHarrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his head harness. The bar snapped\nlike celery. Harrison smashed his headphones and spectacles against the wall.\nHe flung away his rubber\u2013ball nose, revealed a man that would have awed Thor, the god of thunder.\n\u201cI shall now select my Empress!\u201d he said, looking down on the cowering people. \u201cLet the first woman who\ndares rise to her feet claim her mate and her throne!\u201d\nA moment passed, and then a ballerina arose, swaying like a willow.\nHarrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physical handicaps with marvelous\ndelicacy. Last of all, he removed her mask.\nShe was blindingly beautiful.\n\u201cNow\u201d said Harrison, taking her hand, \u201cshall we show the people the meaning of the word dance? Music!\u201d\nhe commanded.\nThe musicians scrambled back into their chairs, and Harrison stripped them of their handicaps, too. \u201cPlay\nyour best,\u201d he told them, \u201cand I\u2019ll make you barons and dukes and earls.\u201d\nThe music began. It was normal at first \u2013 cheap, silly, false. But Harrison snatched two musicians from\ntheir chairs, waved them like batons as he sang the music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back\ninto their chairs.\nThe music began again and was much improved.\nHarrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while \u2013 listened gravely, as though\nsynchronizing their heartbeats with it.\nThey shifted their weights to their toes.\nHarrison placed his big hands on the girl\u2019s tiny waist, letting her sense the weightlessness that would soon\nbe hers.\nAnd then, in an explosion of joy and grace, into the air they sprang!\nNot only were the laws of the land abandoned, but the law of gravity and the laws of motion as well.\nThey reeled, whirled, swiveled, flounced, capered, gamboled, and spun.\nThey leaped like deer on the moon.\nThe studio ceiling was thirty feet high, but each leap brought the dancers nearer to it. It became their\nobvious intention to kiss the ceiling.\nThey kissed it.\nAnd then, neutralizing gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspended in air inches below the\nceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, long time.\nIt was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the studio with a double-\nbarreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and the Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit\nthe floor.\nDiana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians and told them they had ten\nseconds to get their handicaps back on.\nIt was then that the Bergerons\u2019 television tube burned out.\nHazel turned to comment about the blackout to George.\nBut George had gone out into the kitchen for a can of beer.\nGeorge came back in with the beer, paused while a handicap signal shook him up. And then he sat down\nagain. \u201cYou been crying?\u201d he said to Hazel.\n\u201cYup,\u201d she said,\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI forget,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething real sad on television.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all kind of mixed up in my mind,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cForget sad things,\u201d said George.\n\u201cI always do,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d said George. He winced. There was the sound of a riveting gun in his head.\n\u201cGee \u2013 I could tell that one was a doozy,\u201d said Hazel.\n\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d said George.\n\u201cGee \u2013\u201d said Hazel, \u201cI could tell that one was a doozy.\u201d\n"

He looked out the windows at the gigantic sea of emptiness around him and wondered again what the danger had been that had so terrified the men before him.\nOf one thing he was already certain; he would find that nothing was waiting outside the bubble to kill him. The first bubble attendant had committed suicide and the second was a mindless maniac on the Earthbound cruiser but it must have been something inside the bubble that had caused it. Or else they had imagined it all.\nHe went across the small room, his magnetized soles loud on the thin metal floor in the bubble's silence. He sat down in the single chair, his weight very slight in the feeble artificial gravity, and reviewed the known facts.\nThe bubble was a project of Earth's Galactic Observation Bureau, positioned there to gather data from observations that could not be made from within the galaxy. Since metallic mass affected the hypersensitive instruments the bubble had been made as small and light as possible. It was for that reason that it could accommodate only one attendant.\nThe Bureau had selected Horne as the bubble's first attendant and the cruiser left him there for his six months' period of duty. When it made its scheduled return with his replacement he was found dead from a tremendous overdose of sleeping pills. On the table was his daily-report log and his last entry, made three months before:\nI haven't attended to the instruments for a long time because it hates us and doesn't want us here. It hates me the most of all and keeps trying to get into the bubble to kill me. I can hear it whenever I stop and listen and I know it won't be long. I'm afraid of it and I want to be asleep when it comes. But I'll have to make it soon because I have only twenty sleeping pills left and if\u2014\nThe sentence was never finished. According to the temperature recording instruments in the bubble his body ceased radiating heat that same night.\nThe bubble was cleaned, fumigated, and inspected inside and out. No sign of any inimical entity or force could be found.\nSilverman was Horne's replacement. When the cruiser returned six months later bringing him, Green, to be Silverman's replacement, Silverman was completely insane. He babbled about something that had been waiting outside the bubble to kill him but his nearest to a rational statement was to say once, when asked for the hundredth time what he had seen:\n\"Nothing\u2014you can't really see it. But you feel it watching you and you hear it trying to get in to kill you. One time I bumped the wall and\u2014for God's sake\u2014take me away from it\u2014take me back to Earth ...\"\nThen he had tried to hide under the captain's desk and the ship's doctor had led him away.\nThe bubble was minutely examined again and the cruiser employed every detector device it possessed to search surrounding space for light-years in all directions. Nothing was found.\nWhen it was time for the new replacement to be transferred to the bubble he reported to Captain McDowell.\n\"Everything is ready, Green,\" McDowell said. \"You are the next one.\" His shaggy gray eyebrows met in a scowl. \"It would be better if they would let me select the replacement instead of them.\"\nHe flushed with a touch of resentment and said, \"The Bureau found my intelligence and initiative of thought satisfactory.\"\n\"I know\u2014the characteristics you don't need. What they ought to have is somebody like one of my engine room roustabouts, too ignorant to get scared and too dumb to go nuts. Then we could get a sane report six months from now instead of the ravings of a maniac.\"\n\"I suggest,\" he said stiffly, \"that you reserve judgement until that time comes, sir.\"\nAnd that was all he knew about the danger, real or imaginary, that had driven two men into insanity. He would have six months in which to find the answer. Six months minus\u2014 He looked at the chronometer and saw that twenty minutes had passed since he left the cruiser. Somehow, it seemed much longer ...\nHe moved to light a cigarette and his metal soles scraped the floor with the same startling loudness he had noticed before. The bubble was as silent as a tomb.\nIt was not much larger than a tomb; a sphere eighteen feet in diameter, made of thin sheet steel and criss-crossed outside with narrow reinforcing girders to keep the internal air pressure from rupturing it. The floor under him was six feet up from the sphere's bottom and the space beneath held the air regenerator and waste converter units, the storage batteries and the food cabinets. The compartment in which he sat contained chair, table, a narrow cot, banks of dials, a remote-control panel for operating the instruments mounted outside the hull, a microfilm projector, and a pair of exerciser springs attached to one wall. That was all.\nThere was no means of communication since a hyperspace communicator would have affected the delicate instruments with its radiations but there was a small microfilm library to go with the projector so that he should be able to pass away the time pleasantly enough.\nBut it was not the fear of boredom that was behind the apprehension he could already feel touching at his mind. It had not been boredom that had turned Horne into a suicide and Silverman into\u2014\nSomething cracked sharply behind him, like a gunshot in the stillness, and he leaped to his feet, whirling to face it.\nIt was only a metal reel of data tape that had dropped out of the spectrum analyzer into the storage tray.\nHis heart was thumping fast and his attempt to laugh at his nervousness sounded hollow and mirthless. Something inside or outside the bubble had driven two men insane with its threat and now that he was irrevocably exiled in the bubble, himself, he could no longer dismiss their fear as products of their imagination. Both of them had been rational, intelligent men, as carefully selected by the Observation Bureau as he had been.\nHe set in to search the bubble, overlooking nothing. When he crawled down into the lower compartment he hesitated then opened the longest blade of his knife before searching among the dark recesses down there. He found nothing, not even a speck of dust.\nBack in his chair again he began to doubt his first conviction. Perhaps there really had been some kind of an invisible force or entity outside the bubble. Both Horne and Silverman had said that \"it\" had tried to get in to kill them.\nThey had been very definite about that part.\nThere were six windows around the bubble's walls, set there to enable the attendant to see all the outside-mounted instruments and dials. He went to them to look out, one by one, and from all of them he saw the same vast emptiness that surrounded him. The galaxy\u2014his galaxy\u2014was so far away that its stars were like dust. In the other directions the empty gulf was so wide that galaxies and clusters of galaxies were tiny, feeble specks of light shining across it.\nAll around him was a void so huge that galaxies were only specks in it....\nWho could know what forces or dangers might be waiting out there?\nA light blinked, reminding him it was time to attend to his duties. The job required an hour and he was nervous and not yet hungry when he had finished. He went to the exerciser springs on the wall and performed a work-out that left him tired and sweating but which, at least, gave him a small appetite.\nThe day passed, and the next. He made another search of the bubble's interior with the same results as before. He felt almost sure, then, that there was nothing in the bubble with him. He established a routine of work, pastime and sleep that made the first week pass fairly comfortably but for the gnawing worry in his mind that something invisible was lurking just outside the windows.\nThen one day he accidentally kicked the wall with his metal shoe tip.\nIt made a sound like that from kicking a tight-stretched section of tin and it seemed to him it gave a little from the impact, as tin would do. He realized for the first time how thin it was\u2014how deadly, dangerously thin.\nAccording to the specifications he had read it was only one-sixteenth of an inch thick. It was as thin as cardboard.\nHe sat down with pencil and paper and began calculating. The bubble had a surface area of 146,500 square inches and the internal air pressure was fourteen pounds to the square inch. Which meant that the thin metal skin contained a total pressure of 2,051,000 pounds.\nTwo million pounds.\nThe bubble in which he sat was a bomb, waiting to explode the instant any section of the thin metal weakened.\nIt was supposed to be an alloy so extremely strong that it had a high safety factor but he could not believe that any metal so thin could be so strong. It was all right for engineers sitting safely on Earth to speak of high safety factors but his life depended upon the fragile wall not cracking. It made a lot of difference.\nThe next day he thought he felt the hook to which the exerciser spring was attached crack loose from where it was welded to the wall. He inspected the base of the hook closely and there seemed to be a fine, hairline fracture appearing around it.\nHe held his ear to it, listening for any sound of a leak. It was not leaking yet but it could commence doing so at any time. He looked out the windows at the illimitable void that was waiting to absorb his pitiful little supply of air and he thought of the days he had hauled and jerked at the springs with all his strength, not realizing the damage he was doing.\nThere was a sick feeling in his stomach for the rest of the day and he returned again and again to examine the hairline around the hook.\nThe next day he discovered an even more serious threat: the thin skin of the bubble had been spot-welded to the outside reinforcing girders.\nSuch welding often created hard, brittle spots that would soon crystallize from continued movement\u2014and there was a slight temperature difference in the bubble between his working and sleeping hours that would daily produce a contraction and expansion of the skin. Especially when he used the little cooking burner.\nHe quit using the burner for any purpose and began a daily inspection of every square inch of the bubble's walls, marking with white chalk all the welding spots that appeared to be definitely weakened. Each day he found more to mark and soon the little white circles were scattered across the walls wherever he looked.\nWhen he was not working at examining the walls he could feel the windows watching him, like staring eyes. Out of self defense he would have to go to them and stare back at the emptiness.\nSpace was alien; coldly, deadly, alien. He was a tiny spark of life in a hostile sea of Nothing and there was no one to help him. The Nothing outside was waiting day and night for the most infinitesimal leak or crack in the walls; the Nothing that had been waiting out there since time without beginning and would wait for time without end.\nSometimes he would touch his finger to the wall and think, Death is out there, only one-sixteenth of an inch away. His first fears became a black and terrible conviction: the bubble could not continue to resist the attack for long. It had already lasted longer than it should have. Two million pounds of pressure wanted out and all the sucking Nothing of intergalactic space wanted in. And only a thin skin of metal, rotten with brittle welding spots, stood between them.\nIt wanted in\u2014the Nothing wanted in. He knew, then, that Horne and Silverman had not been insane. It wanted in and someday it would get in. When it did it would explode him and jerk out his guts and lungs. Not until that happened, not until the Nothing filled the bubble and enclosed his hideous, turned-inside-out body would it ever be content ...\nHe had long since quit wearing the magnetized shoes, afraid the vibration of them would weaken the bubble still more. And he began noticing sections where the bubble did not seem to be perfectly concave, as though the rolling mill had pressed the metal too thin in places and it was swelling out like an over-inflated balloon.\nHe could not remember when he had last attended to the instruments. Nothing was important but the danger that surrounded him. He knew the danger was rapidly increasing because whenever he pressed his ear to the wall he could hear the almost inaudible tickings and vibrations as the bubble's skin contracted or expanded and the Nothing tapped and searched with its empty fingers for a flaw or crack that it could tear into a leak.\nBut the windows were far the worst, with the Nothing staring in at him day and night. There was no escape from it. He could feel it watching him, malignant and gloating, even when he hid his eyes in his hands.\nThe time came when he could stand it no longer. The cot had a blanket and he used that together with all his spare clothes to make a tent stretching from the table to the first instrument panel. When he crawled under it he found that the lower half of one window could still see him. He used the clothes he was wearing to finish the job and it was much better then, hiding there in the concealing darkness where the Nothing could not see him.\nHe did not mind going naked\u2014the temperature regulators in the bubble never let it get too cold.\nHe had no conception of time from then on. He emerged only when necessary to bring more food into his tent. He could still hear the Nothing tapping and sucking in its ceaseless search for a flaw and he made such emergences as brief as possible, wishing that he did not have to come out at all. Maybe if he could hide in his tent for a long time and never make a sound it would get tired and go away ...\nSometimes he thought of the cruiser and wished they would come for him but most of the time he thought of the thing that was outside, trying to get in to kill him. When the strain became too great he would draw himself up in the position he had once occupied in his mother's womb and pretend he had never left Earth. It was easier there.\nBut always, before very long, the bubble would tick or whisper and he would freeze in terror, thinking, This time it's coming in ...\nThen one day, suddenly, two men were peering under his tent at him.\nOne of them said, \"My God\u2014again!\" and he wondered what he meant. But they were very nice to him and helped him put on his clothes. Later, in the cruiser, everything was hazy and they kept asking him what he was afraid of.\n\"What was it\u2014what did you find?\"\nHe tried hard to think so he could explain it. \"It was\u2014it was Nothing.\"\n\"What were you and Horne and Silverman afraid of\u2014what was it?\" the voice demanded insistently.\n\"I told you,\" he said. \"Nothing.\"\nThey stared at him and the haziness cleared a little as he saw they did not understand. He wanted them to believe him because what he told them was so very true.\n\"It wanted to kill us. Please\u2014can't you believe me? It was waiting outside the bubble to kill us.\"\nBut they kept staring and he knew they didn't believe him. They didn't want to believe him ...\nEverything turned hazy again and he started to cry. He was glad when the doctor took his hand to lead him away ...\nThe bubble was carefully inspected, inside and out, and nothing was found. When it was time for Green's replacement to be transferred to it Larkin reported to Captain McDowell.\n\"Everything is ready, Larkin,\" McDowell said. \"You're the next one. I wish we knew what the danger is.\" He scowled. \"I still think one of my roustabouts from the engine room might give us a sane report six months from now instead of the babblings we'll get from you.\"\nHe felt his face flush and he said stiffly, \"I suggest, sir, that you not jump to conclusions until that time comes.\"\nThe cruiser vanished back into hyperspace and he was alone inside the observation bubble, ten thousand light-years beyond the galaxy's outermost sun. He looked out the windows at the gigantic sea of emptiness around him and wondered again what the danger had been that had so terrified the men before him.\nOf one thing he was already certain; he would find that nothing was waiting outside the bubble to kill him ...\n"

                "content": "\n\"George, I wish you'd look at the nursery.\"\n\"What's wrong with it?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"Well, then.\"\n\"I just want you to look at it, is all, or call a psychologist in to\nlook at it.\"\n\"What would a psychologist want with a nursery?\"\n\"You know very well what he'd want.\" His wife paused in the middle of the kitchen and watched the stove busy humming to itself, making supper for four.\n\"It's just that the nursery is different now than it was.\"\n\"All right, let's have a look.\"\nThey walked down the hall of their soundproofed Happylife Home, which had cost them thirty thousand dollars installed, this house which clothed and fed and rocked them to sleep and played and sang and was good to them.\nTheir approach sensitized a switch somewhere and the nursery light flicked on when they came within ten feet of it. Similarly, behind them, in the halls, lights went on and off as they left them behind, with a soft automaticity.\n\"Well,\" said George Hadley.\nThey stood on the thatched floor of the nursery. It was forty feet across by forty feet long and thirty feet high; it had cost half again as much as the rest of the house. \"But nothing's too good for our children,\" George had said.\nThe nursery was silent. It was empty as a jungle glade at hot high\nnoon. The walls were blank and two dimensional. Now, as George and Lydia Hadley stood in the center of the room, the walls began to purr and recede into crystalline distance, it seemed, and presently an African veldt appeared, in three dimensions, on all sides, in color reproduced to the final pebble and bit of straw. The ceiling above them became a deep sky with a hot yellow sun.\nGeorge Hadley felt the perspiration start on his brow.\n\"Let's get out of this sun,\" he said. \"This is a little too real. But I don't see anything wrong.\"\n\"Wait a moment, you'll see,\" said his wife.\nNow the hidden odorophonics were beginning to blow a wind of odor at the two people in the middle of the baked veldtland. The hot straw smell of lion grass, the cool green smell of the hidden water hole, the great rusty smell of animals, the smell of dust like a red paprika in the hot air. And now the sounds: the thump of distant antelope feet on grassy sod, the papery rustling of vultures. A shadow passed through the sky. The shadow flickered on George Hadley's upturned, sweating face.\n\"Filthy creatures,\" he heard his wife say.\n\"The vultures.\"\n\"You see, there are the lions, far over, that way. Now they're on their way to the water hole. They've just been eating,\" said Lydia. \"I don't know what.\"\n\"Some animal.\" George Hadley put his hand up to shield off the burning light from his squinted eyes. \"A zebra or a baby giraffe, maybe.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" His wife sounded peculiarly tense.\n\"No, it's a little late to be sure,\" he said, amused. \"Nothing over there I can see but cleaned bone, and the vultures dropping for what's left.\"\n\"Did you hear that scream?\" she asked.\n\"No.\"\n\"About a minute ago?\"\n\"Sorry, no.\"\nThe lions were coming. And again George Hadley was filled with\nadmiration for the mechanical genius who had conceived this room. A miracle of efficiency selling for an absurdly low price. Every home should have one.\nOh, occasionally they frightened you with their clinical accuracy, they startled you, gave you a twinge, but most of the time what fun for everyone, not only your own son and daughter, but for yourself when you felt like a quick jaunt to a foreign land, a quick change of scenery. Well, here it was! And here were the lions now, fifteen feet away, so real, so feverishly and startlingly real that you could feel the prickling fur on your hand, and your mouth was stuffed with the dusty upholstery smell of their heated pelts, and the yellow of them was in your eyes like the yellow of an exquisite French tapestry, the yellows of lions and summer grass, and the sound of the matted lion lungs exhaling on the silent noontide, and the smell of meat from the panting, dripping mouths.\nThe lions stood looking at George and Lydia Hadley with terrible\ngreen-yellow eyes.\n\"Watch out!\" screamed Lydia.\nThe lions came running at them.\nLydia bolted and ran. Instinctively, George sprang after her. Outside, in the hall, with the door slammed he was laughing and she was crying, and they both stood appalled at the other's reaction.\n\"George!\"\n\"Lydia! Oh, my dear poor sweet Lydia!\"\n\"They almost got us!\"\n\"Walls, Lydia, remember; crystal walls, that's all they are. Oh, they\nlook real, I must admit - Africa in your parlor - but it's all dimensional, superreactionary, supersensitive color film and mental tape film behind glass screens. It's all odorophonics and sonics, Lydia. Here's my handkerchief.\"\n\"I'm afraid.\" She came to him and put her body against him and cried steadily. \"Did you see? Did you feel? It's too real.\" \"Now, Lydia...\"\n\"You've got to tell Wendy and Peter not to read any more on Africa.\"\n\"Of course - of course.\" He patted her.\n\"Promise?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"And lock the nursery for a few days until I get my nerves settled.\"\n\"You know how difficult Peter is about that. When I punished him a month ago by locking the nursery for even a few hours - the tantrum he threw! And Wendy too. They live for the nursery.\"\n\"It's got to be locked, that's all there is to it.\"\n\"All right.\" Reluctantly he locked the huge door. \"You've been working too hard. You need a rest.\"\n\"I don't know - I don't know,\" she said, blowing her nose, sitting down in a chair that immediately began to rock and comfort her. \"Maybe I don't have enough to do. Maybe I have time to think too much. Why don't we shut the whole house off for a few days and take a vacation?\"\n\"You mean you want to fry my eggs for me?\"\n\"Yes.\" She nodded.\n\"And dam my socks?\"\n\"Yes.\" A frantic, watery-eyed nodding.\n\"And sweep the house?\"\n\"Yes, yes - oh, yes!''\n\"But I thought that's why we bought this house, so we wouldn't have to do anything?\"\n\"That's just it. I feel like I don't belong here. The house is wife and mother now, and nursemaid. Can I compete with an African veldt? Can I give a bath and scrub the children as efficiently or quickly as the automatic scrub bath can? I cannot. And it isn't just me. It's you. You've been awfully nervous lately.\"\n\"I suppose I have been smoking too much.\"\n\"You look as if you didn't know what to do with yourself in this house, either. You smoke a little more every morning and drink a little more every afternoon and need a little more sedative every night. You're beginning to feel unnecessary too.\"\n\"Am I?\" He paused and tried to feel into himself to see what was really there.\n\"Oh, George!\" She looked beyond him, at the nursery door. \"Those lions can't get out of there, can they?\"\nHe looked at the door and saw it tremble as if something had jumped against it from the other side.\n\"Of course not,\" he said.\nAt dinner they ate alone, for Wendy and Peter were at a special plastic carnival across town and bad televised home to say they'd be late, to go ahead eating. So George Hadley, bemused, sat watching the dining-room table produce warm dishes of food from its mechanical interior.\n\"We forgot the ketchup,\" he said.\n\"Sorry,\" said a small voice within the table, and ketchup appeared.\nAs for the nursery, thought George Hadley, it won't hurt for the\nchildren to be locked out of it awhile. Too much of anything isn't good for anyone. And it was clearly indicated that the children had been spending a little too much time on Africa. That sun. He could feel it on his neck, still, like a hot paw. And the lions. And the smell of blood. Remarkable how the nursery caught the telepathic emanations of the children's minds and created life to fill their every desire. The children thought lions, and there were lions. The children thought zebras, and there were zebras. Sun - sun. Giraffes - giraffes. Death and death.\nThat last. He chewed tastelessly on the meat that the table bad cut for him. Death thoughts. They were awfully young, Wendy and Peter, for death thoughts. Or, no, you were never too young, really. Long before you knew what death was you were wishing it on someone else. When you were two years old you were shooting people with cap pistols.\nBut this - the long, hot African veldt-the awful death in the jaws of a lion. And repeated again and again.\n\"Where are you going?\"\nHe didn't answer Lydia. Preoccupied, be let the lights glow softly on\nahead of him, extinguish behind him as he padded to the nursery door. He listened against it. Far away, a lion roared.\nHe unlocked the door and opened it. Just before he stepped inside, he heard a faraway scream. And then another roar from the lions, which subsided quickly.\nHe stepped into Africa. How many times in the last year had he opened this door and found Wonderland, Alice, the Mock Turtle, or Aladdin and his Magical Lamp, or Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz, or Dr. Doolittle, or the cow jumping over a very real-appearing moon-all the delightful contraptions of a make-believe world. How often had he seen Pegasus flying in the sky ceiling, or seen fountains of red fireworks, or heard angel voices singing. But now, is yellow hot Africa, this bake oven with murder in the heat. Perhaps Lydia was right. Perhaps they needed a little vacation from the fantasy which was growing a bit too real for ten-year-old children. It was all right to exercise one's mind with gymnastic fantasies, but when the lively child mind settled on one pattern... ? It seemed that, at a distance, for the past month, he had heard lions roaring, and smelled their strong odor seeping as far away as his study door. But, being busy, he had paid it no attention.\nGeorge Hadley stood on the African grassland alone. The lions looked up from their feeding, watching him. The only flaw to the illusion was the open door through which he could see his wife, far down the dark hall, like a framed picture, eating her dinner abstractedly.\n\"Go away,\" he said to the lions.\nThey did not go.\nHe knew the principle of the room exactly. You sent out your thoughts.\nWhatever you thought would appear. \"Let's have Aladdin and his lamp,\" he snapped. The veldtland remained; the lions remained.\n\"Come on, room! I demand Aladin!\" he said.\nNothing happened. The lions mumbled in their baked pelts.\n\"Aladin!\"\nHe went back to dinner. \"The fool room's out of order,\" he said. \"It won't respond.\"\n\"Or--\"\n\"Or what?\"\n\"Or it can't respond,\" said Lydia, \"because the children have thought about Africa and lions and killing so many days that the room's in a rut.\"\n\"Could be.\"\n\"Or Peter's set it to remain that way.\"\n\"Set it?\"\n\"He may have got into the machinery and fixed something.\"\n\"Peter doesn't know machinery.\"\n\"He's a wise one for ten. That I.Q. of his -\"\n\"Nevertheless -\"\n\"Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.\"\nThe Hadleys turned. Wendy and Peter were coming in the front door,\ncheeks like peppermint candy, eyes like bright blue agate marbles, a smell of ozone on their jumpers from their trip in the helicopter.\n\"You're just in time for supper,\" said both parents.\n\"We're full of strawberry ice cream and hot dogs,\" said the children,\nholding hands. \"But we'll sit and watch.\"\n\"Yes, come tell us about the nursery,\" said George Hadley.\nThe brother and sister blinked at him and then at each other.\n\"Nursery?\"\n\"All about Africa and everything,\" said the father with false\njoviality.\n\"I don't understand,\" said Peter.\n\"Your mother and I were just traveling through Africa with rod and\nreel; Tom Swift and his Electric Lion,\" said George Hadley.\n\"There's no Africa in the nursery,\" said Peter simply.\n\"Oh, come now, Peter. We know better.\"\n\"I don't remember any Africa,\" said Peter to Wendy. \"Do you?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Run see and come tell.\"\nShe obeyed\n\"Wendy, come back here!\" said George Hadley, but she was gone. The\nhouse lights followed her like a flock of fireflies. Too late, he realized he had forgotten to lock the nursery door after his last inspection.\n\"Wendy'll look and come tell us,\" said Peter.\n\"She doesn't have to tell me. I've seen it.\"\n\"I'm sure you're mistaken, Father.\"\n\"I'm not, Peter. Come along now.\"\nBut Wendy was back. \"It's not Africa,\" she said breathlessly.\n\"We'll see about this,\" said George Hadley, and they all walked down\nthe hall together and opened the nursery door.\nThere was a green, lovely forest, a lovely river, a purple mountain,\nhigh voices singing, and Rima, lovely and mysterious, lurking in the trees with colorful flights of butterflies, like animated bouquets, lingering in her long hair. The African veldtland was gone. The lions were gone. Only Rima was here now, singing a song so beautiful that it brought tears to your eyes.\nGeorge Hadley looked in at the changed scene. \"Go to bed,\" he said to\nthe children.\nThey opened their mouths.\n\"You heard me,\" he said.\nThey went off to the air closet, where a wind sucked them like brown leaves up the flue to their slumber rooms.\nGeorge Hadley walked through the singing glade and picked up something\nthat lay in the comer near where the lions had been. He walked slowly back to his wife.\n\"What is that?\" she asked.\n\"An old wallet of mine,\" he said.\nHe showed it to her. The smell of hot grass was on it and the smell of\na lion. There were drops of saliva on it, it bad been chewed, and there were blood smears on both sides.\nHe closed the nursery door and locked it, tight.\nIn the middle of the night he was still awake and he knew his wife was awake. \"Do you think Wendy changed it?\" she said at last, in the dark room.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Made it from a veldt into a forest and put Rima there instead of\nlions?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't know. But it's staying locked until I find out.\"\n\"How did your wallet get there?\"\n\"I don't know anything,\" he said, \"except that I'm beginning to be\nsorry we bought that room for the children. If children are neurotic at all, a room like that -\"\n\"It's supposed to help them work off their neuroses in a healthful\nway.\"\n\"I'm starting to wonder.\" He stared at the ceiling.\n\"We've given the children everything they ever wanted. Is this our\nreward-secrecy, disobedience?\"\n\"Who was it said, 'Children are carpets, they should be stepped on\noccasionally'? We've never lifted a hand. They're insufferable - let's admit it. They come and go when they like; they treat us as if we were offspring.\nThey're spoiled and we're spoiled.\"\n\"They've been acting funny ever since you forbade them to take the\nrocket to New York a few months ago.\"\n\"They're not old enough to do that alone, I explained.\"\n\"Nevertheless, I've noticed they've been decidedly cool toward us\nsince.\"\n\"I think I'll have David McClean come tomorrow morning to have a look at Africa.\"\n\"But it's not Africa now, it's Green Mansions country and Rima.\"\n\"I have a feeling it'll be Africa again before then.\"\nA moment later they heard the screams.\nTwo screams. Two people screaming from downstairs. And then a roar of lions.\n\"Wendy and Peter aren't in their rooms,\" said his wife.\nHe lay in his bed with his beating heart. \"No,\" he said. \"They've\nbroken into the nursery.\"\n\"Those screams - they sound familiar.\"\n\"Do they?\"\n\"Yes, awfully.\"\nAnd although their beds tried very bard, the two adults couldn't be\nrocked to sleep for another hour. A smell of cats was in the night air.\n\"Father?\" said Peter.\n\"Yes.\"\nPeter looked at his shoes. He never looked at his father any more, nor at his mother. \"You aren't going to lock up the nursery for good, are you?\"\n\"That all depends.\"\n\"On what?\" snapped Peter.\n\"On you and your sister. If you intersperse this Africa with a little\nvariety - oh, Sweden perhaps, or Denmark or China -\"\n\"I thought we were free to play as we wished.\"\n\"You are, within reasonable bounds.\"\n\"What's wrong with Africa, Father?\"\n\"Oh, so now you admit you have been conjuring up Africa, do you?\"\n\"I wouldn't want the nursery locked up,\" said Peter coldly. \"Ever.\"\n\"Matter of fact, we're thinking of turning the whole house off for\nabout a month. Live sort of a carefree one-for-all existence.\"\n\"That sounds dreadful! Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of\nletting the shoe tier do it? And brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath?\"\n\"It would be fun for a change, don't you think?\"\n\"No, it would be horrid. I didn't like it when you took out the picture painter last month.\" \"That's because I wanted you to learn to paint all by yourself, son.\"\n\"I don't want to do anything but look and listen and smell; what else\nis there to do?\"\n\"All right, go play in Africa.\"\n\"Will you shut off the house sometime soon?\"\n\"We're considering it.\"\n\"I don't think you'd better consider it any more, Father.\"\n\"I won't have any threats from my son!\"\n\"Very well.\" And Peter strolled off to the nursery.\n\"Am I on time?\" said David McClean.\n\"Breakfast?\" asked George Hadley.\n\"Thanks, had some. What's the trouble?\"\n\"David, you're a psychologist.\"\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\"Well, then, have a look at our nursery. You saw it a year ago when you dropped by; did you notice anything peculiar about it then?\"\n\"Can't say I did; the usual violences, a tendency toward a slight\nparanoia here or there, usual in children because they feel persecuted by parents constantly, but, oh, really nothing.\"\nThey walked down the ball. \"I locked the nursery up,\" explained the\nfather, \"and the children broke back into it during the night. I let them stay so they could form the patterns for you to see.\"\nThere was a terrible screaming from the nursery.\n\"There it is,\" said George Hadley. \"See what you make of it.\"\nThey walked in on the children without rapping.\nThe screams had faded. The lions were feeding.\n\"Run outside a moment, children,\" said George Hadley. \"No, don't change the mental combination. Leave the walls as they are. Get!\"\nWith the children gone, the two men stood studying the lions clustered at a distance, eating with great relish whatever it was they had caught.\n\"I wish I knew what it was,\" said George Hadley. \"Sometimes I can\nalmost see. Do you think if I brought high-powered binoculars here and -\"\nDavid McClean laughed dryly. \"Hardly.\" He turned to study all four walls. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\"A little over a month.\"\n\"It certainly doesn't feel good.\"\n\"I want facts, not feelings.\"\n\"My dear George, a psychologist never saw a fact in his life. He only\nhears about feelings; vague things. This doesn't feel good, I tell you.\nTrust my hunches and my instincts. I have a nose for something bad. This is very bad. My advice to you is to have the whole damn room torn down and your children brought to me every day during the next year for treatment.\"\n\"Is it that bad?\"\n\"I'm afraid so. One of the original uses of these nurseries was so that we could study the patterns left on the walls by the child's mind, study at our leisure, and help the child. In this case, however, the room has become a channel toward-destructive thoughts, instead of a release away from them.\"\n\"Didn't you sense this before?\"\n\"I sensed only that you bad spoiled your children more than most. And now you're letting them down in some way. What way?\"\n\"I wouldn't let them go to New York.\"\n\"What else?\"\n\"I've taken a few machines from the house and threatened them, a month\nago, with closing up the nursery unless they did their homework. I did close it for a few days to show I meant business.\"\n\"Ah, ha!\"\n\"Does that mean anything?\"\n\"Everything. Where before they had a Santa Claus now they have a\nScrooge. Children prefer Santas. You've let this room and this house replace you and your wife in your children's affections. This room is their mother and father, far more important in their lives than their real parents. And now you come along and want to shut it off. No wonder there's hatred here.\nYou can feel it coming out of the sky. Feel that sun. George, you'll have to change your life. Like too many others, you've built it around creature comforts. Why, you'd starve tomorrow if something went wrong in your kitchen. You wouldn't know bow to tap an egg. Nevertheless, turn everything off. Start new. It'll take time. But we'll make good children out of bad in a year, wait and see.\"\n\"But won't the shock be too much for the children, shutting the room up abruptly, for good?\"\n\"I don't want them going any deeper into this, that's all.\"\nThe lions were finished with their red feast.\nThe lions were standing on the edge of the clearing watching the two\nmen.\n\"Now I'm feeling persecuted,\" said McClean. \"Let's get out of here. I\nnever have cared for these damned rooms. Make me nervous.\"\n\"The lions look real, don't they?\" said George Hadley. I don't suppose there's any way -\"\n\"What?\"\n\"- that they could become real?\"\n\"Not that I know.\"\n\"Some flaw in the machinery, a tampering or something?\"\n\"No.\"\nThey went to the door.\n\"I don't imagine the room will like being turned off,\" said the father.\n\"Nothing ever likes to die - even a room.\"\n\"I wonder if it hates me for wanting to switch it off?\"\n\"Paranoia is thick around here today,\" said David McClean. \"You can\nfollow it like a spoor. Hello.\" He bent and picked up a bloody scarf. \"This yours?\"\n\"No.\" George Hadley's face was rigid. \"It belongs to Lydia.\"\nThey went to the fuse box together and threw the switch that killed the nursery.\nThe two children were in hysterics. They screamed and pranced and threw things. They yelled and sobbed and swore and jumped at the furniture.\n\"You can't do that to the nursery, you can't!''\n\"Now, children.\"\nThe children flung themselves onto a couch, weeping.\n\"George,\" said Lydia Hadley, \"turn on the nursery, just for a few\nmoments. You can't be so abrupt.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"You can't be so cruel...\"\n\"Lydia, it's off, and it stays off. And the whole damn house dies as of here and now. The more I see of the mess we've put ourselves in, the more it sickens me. We've been contemplating our mechanical, electronic navels for too long. My God, how we need a breath of honest air!\"\nAnd he marched about the house turning off the voice clocks, the\nstoves, the heaters, the shoe shiners, the shoe lacers, the body scrubbers and swabbers and massagers, and every other machine be could put his hand to.\nThe house was full of dead bodies, it seemed. It felt like a mechanical cemetery. So silent. None of the humming hidden energy of machines waiting to function at the tap of a button.\n\"Don't let them do it!\" wailed Peter at the ceiling, as if he was\ntalking to the house, the nursery. \"Don't let Father kill everything.\" He turned to his father. \"Oh, I hate you!\"\n\"Insults won't get you anywhere.\"\n\"I wish you were dead!\"\n\"We were, for a long while. Now we're going to really start living.\nInstead of being handled and massaged, we're going to live.\"\nWendy was still crying and Peter joined her again. \"Just a moment, just one moment, just another moment of nursery,\" they wailed.\n\"Oh, George,\" said the wife, \"it can't hurt.\"\n\"All right - all right, if they'll just shut up. One minute, mind you,\nand then off forever.\"\n\"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!\" sang the children, smiling with wet faces. \"And then we're going on a vacation. David McClean is coming back in half an hour to help us move out and get to the airport. I'm going to dress. You turn the nursery on for a minute, Lydia, just a minute, mind you.\"\nAnd the three of them went babbling off while he let himself be\nvacuumed upstairs through the air flue and set about dressing himself. A minute later Lydia appeared.\n\"I'll be glad when we get away,\" she sighed.\n\"Did you leave them in the nursery?\"\n\"I wanted to dress too. Oh, that horrid Africa. What can they see in\nit?\"\n\"Well, in five minutes we'll be on our way to Iowa. Lord, how did we\never get in this house? What prompted us to buy a nightmare?\"\n\"Pride, money, foolishness.\"\n\"I think we'd better get downstairs before those kids get engrossed\nwith those damned beasts again.\"\nJust then they heard the children calling, \"Daddy, Mommy, come quick - quick!\"\nThey went downstairs in the air flue and ran down the hall. The\nchildren were nowhere in sight. \"Wendy? Peter!\"\nThey ran into the nursery. The veldtland was empty save for the lions waiting, looking at them. \"Peter, Wendy?\"\nThe door slammed.\n\"Wendy, Peter!\"\nGeorge Hadley and his wife whirled and ran back to the door.\n\"Open the door!\" cried George Hadley, trying the knob. \"Why, they've locked it from the outside! Peter!\" He beat at the door. \"Open up!\"\nHe heard Peter's voice outside, against the door.\n\"Don't let them switch off the nursery and the house,\" he was saying.\nMr. and Mrs. George Hadley beat at the door. \"Now, don't be ridiculous, children. It's time to go. Mr. McClean'll be here in a minute and...\"\nAnd then they heard the sounds.\nThe lions on three sides of them, in the yellow veldt grass, padding\nthrough the dry straw, rumbling and roaring in their throats.\nThe lions.\nMr. Hadley looked at his wife and they turned and looked back at the beasts edging slowly forward crouching, tails stiff.\nMr. and Mrs. Hadley screamed.\nAnd suddenly they realized why those other screams bad sounded familiar.\n\"Well, here I am,\" said David McClean in the nursery doorway, \"Oh,\nhello.\" He stared at the two children seated in the center of the open glade eating a little picnic lunch. Beyond them was the water hole and the yellow veldtland; above was the hot sun. He began to perspire. \"Where are your father and mother?\"\nThe children looked up and smiled. \"Oh, they'll be here directly.\"\n\"Good, we must get going.\" At a distance Mr. McClean saw the lions\nfighting and clawing and then quieting down to feed in silence under the shady trees.\nHe squinted at the lions with his hand tip to his eyes.\nNow the lions were done feeding. They moved to the water hole to drink.\nA shadow flickered over Mr. McClean's hot face. Many shadows flickered.\nThe vultures were dropping down the blazing sky.\n\"A cup of tea?\" asked Wendy in the silence.\n"

                "content": "\nThe hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went to Madrid.\n\u2018What should we drink?\u2019 the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.\n\u2018It\u2019s pretty hot,\u2019 the man said.\n\u2018Let\u2019s drink beer.\u2019\n\u2018Dos cervezas,\u2019 the man said into the curtain.\n\u2018Big ones?\u2019 a woman asked from the doorway.\n\u2018Yes. Two big ones.\u2019\nThe woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the felt pads and the beer glass on the table and looked at the man and the girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry.\n\u2018They look like white elephants,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018I\u2019ve never seen one,\u2019 the man drank his beer.\n\u2018No, you wouldn\u2019t have.\u2019\n\u2018I might have,\u2019 the man said. \u2018Just because you say I wouldn\u2019t have doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u2019\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain. \u2018They\u2019ve painted something on it,\u2019 she said. \u2018What does it say?\u2019\n\u2018Anis del Toro. It\u2019s a drink.\u2019\n\u2018Could we try it?\u2019\nThe man called \u2018Listen\u2019 through the curtain. The woman came out from the bar.\n\u2018Four reales.\u2019 \u2018We want two Anis del Toro.\u2019\n\u2018With water?\u2019\n\u2018Do you want it with water?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 the girl said. \u2018Is it good with water?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019\n\u2018You want them with water?\u2019 asked the woman.\n\u2018Yes, with water.\u2019\n\u2018It tastes like liquorice,\u2019 the girl said and put the glass down.\n\u2018That\u2019s the way with everything.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018Everything tastes of liquorice. Especially all the things you\u2019ve waited so long for, like absinthe.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, cut it out.\u2019\n\u2018You started it,\u2019 the girl said. \u2018I was being amused. I was having a fine time.\u2019\n\u2018Well, let\u2019s try and have a fine time.\u2019\n\u2018All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasn\u2019t that bright?\u2019\n\u2018That was bright.\u2019\n\u2018I wanted to try this new drink. That\u2019s all we do, isn\u2019t it \u2013 look at things and try new drinks?\u2019\n\u2018I guess so.\u2019\nThe girl looked across at the hills.\u2018They\u2019re lovely hills,\u2019 she said. \u2018They don\u2019t really look like white elephants. I just meant the colouring of their skin through the trees.\u2019\n\u2018Should we have another drink?\u2019\n\u2018All right.\u2019\nThe warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.\n\u2018The beer\u2019s nice and cool,\u2019 the man said.\n\u2018It\u2019s lovely,\u2019 the girl said.\n\u2018It\u2019s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,\u2019 the man said. \u2018It\u2019s not really an operation at all.\u2019\nThe girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.\n\u2018I know you wouldn\u2019t mind it, Jig. It\u2019s really not anything. It\u2019s just to let the air in.\u2019\nThe girl did not say anything.\n\u2018I\u2019ll go with you and I\u2019ll stay with you all the time. They just let the air in and then it\u2019s all perfectly natural.\u2019\n\u2018Then what will we do afterwards?\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll be fine afterwards. Just like we were before.\u2019\n\u2018What makes you think so?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the only thing that bothers us. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s made us unhappy.\u2019\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads.\n\u2018And you think then we\u2019ll be all right and be happy.\u2019\n\u2018I know we will. You don\u2019t have to be afraid. I\u2019ve known lots of people that have done it.\u2019\n\u2018So have I,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018And afterwards they were all so happy.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 the man said, \u2018if you don\u2019t want to you don\u2019t have to. I wouldn\u2019t have you do it if you didn\u2019t want to. But I know it\u2019s perfectly simple.\u2019\n\u2018And you really want to?\u2019\n\u2018I think it\u2019s the best thing to do. But I don\u2019t want you to do it if you don\u2019t really want to.\u2019\n\u2018And if I do it you\u2019ll be happy and things will be like they were and you\u2019ll love me?\u2019\n\u2018I love you now. You know I love you.\u2019\n\u2018I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and you\u2019ll like it?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll love it. I love it now but I just can\u2019t think about it. You know how I get when I worry.\u2019\n\u2018If I do it you won\u2019t ever worry?\u2019\n\u2018I won\u2019t worry about that because it\u2019s perfectly simple.\u2019\n\u2018Then I\u2019ll do it. Because I don\u2019t care about me.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t care about me.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I care about you.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, yes. But I don\u2019t care about me. And I\u2019ll do it and then everything will be fine.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t want you to do it if you feel that way.\u2019\nThe girl stood up and walked to the end of the station. Across, on the other side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro. Far away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.\n\u2018And we could have all this,\u2019 she said. \u2018And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible.\u2019\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019\n\u2018I said we could have everything.\u2019\n\u2018We can have everything.\u2019\n\u2018No, we can\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018We can have the whole world.\u2019\n\u2018No, we can\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018We can go everywhere.\u2019\n\u2018No, we can\u2019t. It isn\u2019t ours any more.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s ours.\u2019\n\u2018No, it isn\u2019t. And once they take it away, you never get it back.\u2019\n\u2018But they haven\u2019t taken it away.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll wait and see.\u2019\n\u2018Come on back in the shade,\u2019 he said. \u2018You mustn\u2019t feel that way.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t feel any way,\u2019 the girl said. \u2018I just know things.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t want you to do anything that you don\u2019t want to do -\u2019\n\u2018Nor that isn\u2019t good for me,\u2019 she said. \u2018I know. Could we have another beer?\u2019\n\u2018All right. But you\u2019ve got to realize \u2013 \u2018\n\u2018I realize,\u2019 the girl said. \u2018Can\u2019t we maybe stop talking?\u2019\nThey sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table.\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to realize,\u2019 he said, \u2018 that I don\u2019t want you to do it if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means anything to you.\u2019\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t it mean anything to you? We could get along.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it does. But I don\u2019t want anybody but you. I don\u2019t want anyone else. And I know it\u2019s\nperfectly simple.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, you know it\u2019s perfectly simple.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all right for you to say that, but I do know it.\u2019\n\u2018Would you do something for me now?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d do anything for you.\u2019\n\u2018Would you please please please please please please please stop talking?\u2019\nHe did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the station. There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights.\n\u2018But I don\u2019t want you to,\u2019 he said, \u2018I don\u2019t care anything about it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll scream,\u2019 the girl said.\nThe woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put them down on the damp felt pads. \u2018The train comes in five minutes,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018What did she say?\u2019 asked the girl.\n\u2018That the train is coming in five minutes.\u2019\nThe girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.\n\u2018I\u2019d better take the bags over to the other side of the station,\u2019 the man said. She smiled at him.\n\u2018All right. Then come back and we\u2019ll finish the beer.\u2019\nHe picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to the other tracks. He looked up the tracks but could not see the train. Coming back, he walked through the bar-room, where people waiting for the train were drinking. He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the people. They were all waiting reasonably for the train. He went out through the bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and smiled at him.\n\u2018Do you feel better?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018I feel fine,\u2019 she said. \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.\u2019\n"

Eckels felt his eyelids\nblink over his stare, and the sign burned in this momentary darkness:\nTIME SAFARI, INC.\nSAFARIS TO ANY YEAR IN THE PAST.\nYOU NAME THE ANIMAL.\nWE TAKE YOU THERE. YOU SHOOT IT. Warm phlegm gathered in Eckels' throat; he swallowed and pushed it down. The muscles around\nhis mouth formed a smile as he put his hand slowly out upon the air, and in that hand waved a\ncheck for ten thousand dollars to the man behind the desk.\n\"Does this safari guarantee I come back alive?\"\n\"We guarantee nothing,\" said the official, \"except the dinosaurs.\" He turned. \"This is Mr. Travis,\nyour Safari Guide in the Past. He'll tell you what and where to shoot. If he says no shooting, no\nshooting. If you disobey instructions, there's a stiff penalty of another ten thousand dollars, plus\npossible government action, on your return.\"\nEckels glanced across the vast office at a mass and tangle, a snaking and humming of wires and\nsteel boxes, at an aurora that flickered now orange, now silver, now blue. There was a sound like\na gigantic bonfire burning all of Time, all the years and all the parchment calendars, all the hours\npiled high and set aflame.\nA touch of the hand and this burning would, on the instant, beautifully reverse itself. Eckels\nremembered the wording in the advertisements to the letter. Out of chars and ashes, out of dust\nand coals, like golden salamanders, the old years, the green years, might leap; roses sweeten the\nair, white hair turn Irish\u00adblack, wrinkles vanish; all, everything fly back to seed, flee death, rush\ndown to their beginnings, suns rise in western skies and set in glorious easts, moons eat\nthemselves opposite to the custom, all and everything cupping one in another like Chinese boxes,\nrabbits into hats, all and everything returning to the fresh death, the seed death, the green death, to\nthe time before the beginning. A touch of a hand might do it, the merest touch of a hand.\n\"Unbelievable.\" Eckels breathed, the light of the Machine on his thin face. \"A real Time\nMachine.\" He shook his head. \"Makes you think, If the election had gone badly yesterday, I\nmight be here now running away from the results. Thank God Keith won. He'll make a fine\nPresident of the United States.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the man behind the desk. \"We're lucky. If Deutscher had gotten in, we'd have the\nworst kind of dictatorship. There's an anti everything man for you, a militarist, anti\u00adChrist, anti\u00ad human, anti\u00adintellectual. People called us up, you know, joking but not joking. Said if Deutscher\nbecame President they wanted to go live in 1492. Of course it's not our business to conduct\nEscapes, but to form Safaris. Anyway, Keith's President now. All you got to worry about is\u00ad\"\n\"Shooting my dinosaur,\" Eckels finished it for him.\n\"A Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Tyrant Lizard, the most incredible monster in history. Sign this\nrelease. Anything happens to you, we're not responsible. Those dinosaurs are hungry.\"\nEckels flushed angrily. \"Trying to scare me!\"\n\"Frankly, yes. We don't want anyone going who'll panic at the first shot. Six Safari leaders were\nkilled last year, and a dozen hunters. We're here to give you the severest thrill a real hunter ever\nasked for. Traveling you back sixty million years to bag the biggest game in all of Time. Your\npersonal check's still there. Tear it up.\"Mr. Eckels looked at the check. His fingers twitched.\n\"Good luck,\" said the man behind the desk. \"Mr. Travis, he's all yours.\"\nThey moved silently across the room, taking their guns with them, toward the Machine, toward\nthe silver metal and the roaring light.\nFirst a day and then a night and then a day and then a night, then it was day\u00adnight\u00adday\u00adnight. A\nweek, a month, a year, a decade! A.D. 2055. A.D. 2019. 1999! 1957! Gone! The Machine roared.\nThey put on their oxygen helmets and tested the intercoms.\nEckels swayed on the padded seat, his face pale, his jaw stiff. He felt the trembling in his arms\nand he looked down and found his hands tight on the new rifle. There were four other men in the\nMachine. Travis, the Safari Leader, his assistant, Lesperance, and two other hunters, Billings and\nKramer. They sat looking at each other, and the years blazed around them.\n\"Can these guns get a dinosaur cold?\" Eckels felt his mouth saying.\n\"If you hit them right,\" said Travis on the helmet radio. \"Some dinosaurs have two brains, one in\nthe head, another far down the spinal column. We stay away from those. That's stretching luck. Put your first two shots into the eyes, if you can, blind them, and go back into the brain.\"\nThe Machine howled. Time was a film run backward. Suns fled and ten million moons fled after\nthem. \"Think,\" said Eckels. \"Every hunter that ever lived would envy us today. This makes Africa\nseem like Illinois.\"\nThe Machine slowed; its scream fell to a murmur. The Machine stopped.\nThe sun stopped in the sky.\nThe fog that had enveloped the Machine blew away and they were in an old time, a very old time\nindeed, three hunters and two Safari Heads with their blue metal guns across their knees.\n\"Christ isn't born yet,\" said Travis, \"Moses has not gone to the mountains to talk with God. The\nPyramids are still in the earth, waiting to be cut out and put up. Remember that. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler\u00adnone of them exists.\" The man nodded.\n\"That\" \u00ad Mr. Travis pointed \u00ad \"is the jungle of sixty million two thousand and fifty\u00adfive years\nbefore President Keith.\"\nHe indicated a metal path that struck off into green wilderness, over streaming swamp, among\ngiant ferns and palms.\n\"And that,\" he said, \"is the Path, laid by Time Safari for your use,\nIt floats six inches above the earth. Doesn't touch so much as one grass blade, flower, or tree. It's\nan anti\u00adgravity metal. Its purpose is to keep you from touching this world of the past in any way. Stay on the Path. Don't go off it. I repeat. Don't go off. For any reason! If you fall off, there's a\npenalty. And don't shoot any animal we don't okay.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Eckels.\nThey sat in the ancient wilderness. Far birds' cries blew on a wind, and the smell of tar and an old\nsalt sea, moist grasses, and flowers the color of blood.\n\"We don't want to change the Future. We don't belong here in the Past. The government doesn't\nlike us here. We have to pay big graft to keep our franchise. A Time Machine is finicky business.\nNot knowing it, we might kill an important animal, a small bird, a roach, a flower even, thus\ndestroying an important link in a growing species.\"\n\"That's not clear,\" said Eckels.\n\"All right,\" Travis continued, \"say we accidentally kill one mouse here. That means all the future\nfamilies of this one particular mouse are destroyed, right?\"\n\"Right\"\n\"And all the families of the families of the families of that one mouse! With a stamp of your foot,\nyou annihilate first one, then a dozen, then a thousand, a million, a billion possible mice!\"\n\"So they're dead,\" said Eckels. \"So what?\"\n\"So what?\" Travis snorted quietly. \"Well, what about the foxes that'll need those mice to survive?\nFor want of ten mice, a fox dies. For want of ten foxes a lion starves. For want of a lion, all\nmanner of insects, vultures, infinite billions of life forms are thrown into chaos and destruction. Eventually it all boils down to this: fifty\u00adnine million years later, a caveman, one of a dozen on\nthe entire world, goes hunting wild boar or saber\u00adtoothed tiger for food. But you, friend, have\nstepped on all the tigers in that region. By stepping on one single mouse. So the caveman starves.\nAnd the caveman, please note, is not just any expendable man, no! He is an entire future nation. From his loins would have sprung ten sons. From their loins one hundred sons, and thus onward\nto a civilization. Destroy this one man, and you destroy a race, a people, an entire history of life.\nIt is comparable to slaying some of Adam's grandchildren. The stomp of your foot, on one mouse, could start an earthquake, the effects of which could shake our earth and destinies down through\nTime, to their very foundations. With the death of that one caveman, a billion others yet unborn\nare throttled in the womb. Perhaps Rome never rises on its seven hills. Perhaps Europe is forever\na dark forest, and only Asia waxes healthy and teeming. Step on a mouse and you crush the\nPyramids. Step on a mouse and you leave your print, like a Grand Canyon, across Eternity. Queen\nElizabeth might never be born, Washington might not cross the Delaware, there might never be a\nUnited States at all. So be careful. Stay on the Path. Never step off!\"\n\"I see,\" said Eckels. \"Then it wouldn't pay for us even to touch the grass?\"\n\"Correct. Crushing certain plants could add up infinitesimally. A little error here would multiply\nin sixty million years, all out of proportion. Of course maybe our theory is wrong. Maybe Time\ncan't be changed by us. Or maybe it can be changed only in little subtle ways. A dead mouse here\nmakes an insect imbalance there, a population disproportion later, a bad harvest further on, a\ndepression, mass starvation, and finally, a change in social temperament in far\u00adflung countries.\nSomething much more subtle, like that. Perhaps only a soft breath, a whisper, a hair, pollen on the\nair, such a slight, slight change that unless you looked close you wouldn't see it. Who knows?\nWho really can say he knows? We don't know. We're guessing. But until we do know for certain\nwhether our messing around in Time can make a big roar or a little rustle in history, we're being\ncareful. This Machine, this Path, your clothing and bodies, were sterilized, as you know, before\nthe journey. We wear these oxygen helmets so we can't introduce our bacteria into an ancient\natmosphere.\"\n\"How do we know which animals to shoot?\"\n\"They're marked with red paint,\" said Travis. \"Today, before our journey, we sent Lesperance\nhere back with the Machine. He came to this particular era and followed certain animals.\"\n\"Studying them?\"\n\"Right,\" said Lesperance. \"I track them through their entire existence, noting which of them lives\nlongest. Very few. How many times they mate. Not often. Life's short, When I find one that's\ngoing to die when a tree falls on him, or one that drowns in a tar pit, I note the exact hour, minute, and second. I shoot a paint bomb. It leaves a red patch on his side. We can't miss it. Then I\ncorrelate our arrival in the Past so that we meet the Monster not more than two minutes before he\nwould have died anyway. This way, we kill only animals with no future, that are never going to\nmate again. You see how careful we are?\"\n\"But if you come back this morning in Time,\" said Eckels eagerly, you must've bumped into us,\nour Safari! How did it turn out? Was it successful? Did all of us get through\u00adalive?\"\nTravis and Lesperance gave each other a look.\n\"That'd be a paradox,\" said the latter. \"Time doesn't permit that sort of mess\u00ada man meeting\nhimself. When such occasions threaten, Time steps aside. Like an airplane hitting an air pocket.\nYou felt the Machine jump just before we stopped? That was us passing ourselves on the way\nback to the Future. We saw nothing. There's no way of telling if this expedition was a success, if\nwe got our monster, or whether all of us \u00ad meaning you, Mr. Eckels \u00ad got out alive.\"\nEckels smiled palely.\n\"Cut that,\" said Travis sharply. \"Everyone on his feet!\"\nThey were ready to leave the Machine.\nThe jungle was high and the jungle was broad and the jungle was the entire world forever and\nforever. Sounds like music and sounds like flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls\nsoaring with cavernous gray wings, gigantic bats of delirium and night fever.\nEckels, balanced on the narrow Path, aimed his rifle playfully.\n\"Stop that!\" said Travis. \"Don't even aim for fun, blast you! If your guns should go off \u00ad \u00ad \"\nEckels flushed. \"Where's our Tyrannosaurus?\"\nLesperance checked his wristwatch. \"Up ahead, We'll bisect his trail in sixty seconds. Look for\nthe red paint! Don't shoot till we give the word. Stay on the Path. Stay on the Path!\"\nThey moved forward in the wind of morning.\n\"Strange,\" murmured Eckels. \"Up ahead, sixty million years, Election Day over. Keith made\nPresident. Everyone celebrating. And here we are, a million years lost, and they don't exist. The\nthings we worried about for months, a lifetime, not even born or thought of yet.\"\n\"Safety catches off, everyone!\" ordered Travis. \"You, first shot, Eckels. Second, Billings, Third, Kramer.\"\n\"I've hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,\" said Eckels. \"I'm shaking like\na kid.\"\n\"Ah,\" said Travis.\nEveryone stopped.\nTravis raised his hand. \"Ahead,\" he whispered. \"In the mist. There he is. There's His Royal\nMajesty now.\"\nThe jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs.\nSuddenly it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door.\nSilence.\nA sound of thunder.\nOut of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\"It,\" whispered Eckels. \"It......\n\"Sh!\"\nIt came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great\nevil god, folding its delicate watchmaker's claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg\nwas a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a\ngleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and\nsteel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled\nout front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck\ncoiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save\nhunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes,\nits taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight.\nIt ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit\narea warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.\n\"Why, why,\" Eckels twitched his mouth. \"It could reach up and grab the moon.\"\n\"Sh!\" Travis jerked angrily. \"He hasn't seen us yet.\"\n\"It can't be killed,\" Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He\nhad weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed a\ncap gun. \"We were fools to come. This is impossible.\"\n\"Shut up!\" hissed Travis.\n\"Nightmare.\"\n\"Turn around,\" commanded Travis. \"Walk quietly to the Machine. We'll remit half your fee.\"\n\"I didn't realize it would be this big,\" said Eckels. \"I miscalculated, that's all. And now I want\nout.\"\n\"It sees us!\"\n\"There's the red paint on its chest!\"\nThe Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armored flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins,\ncrusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to\ntwitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh\nblew down the wilderness.\n\"Get me out of here,\" said Eckels. \"It was never like this before. I was always sure I'd come\nthrough alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I've met my\nmatch and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.\"\n\"Don't run,\" said Lesperance. \"Turn around. Hide in the Machine.\"\n\"Yes.\" Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave\na grunt of helplessness.\n\"Eckels!\"\nHe took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.\n\"Not that way!\"\nThe Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred\nyards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast's mouth\nengulfed them in the stench of slime and old blood. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun.\nThe rifles cracked again, their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the\nreptile's tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The\nMonster twitched its jeweler's hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush\nthem like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulderstone eyes\nleveled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the\nblazing black iris,\nLike a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.\nThundering, it clutched trees, pulled them with it. It wrenched and tore the metal Path. The men\nflung themselves back and away. The body hit, ten tons of cold flesh and stone. The guns fired. The Monster lashed its armored tail, twitched its snake jaws, and lay still. A fount of blood\nspurted from its throat. Somewhere inside, a sac of fluids burst. Sickening gushes drenched the\nhunters. They stood, red and glistening.\nThe thunder faded.\nThe jungle was silent. After the avalanche, a green peace. After the nightmare, morning.\nBillings and Kramer sat on the pathway and threw up. Travis and Lesperance stood with smoking\nrifles, cursing steadily. In the Time Machine, on his face, Eckels lay shivering. He had found his\nway back to the Path, climbed into the Machine.\nTravis came walking, glanced at Eckels, took cotton gauze from a metal box, and returned to the\nothers, who were sitting on the Path.\n\"Clean up.\"\nThey wiped the blood from their helmets. They began to curse too. The Monster lay, a hill of\nsolid flesh. Within, you could hear the sighs and murmurs as the furthest chambers of it died, the\norgans malfunctioning, liquids running a final instant from pocket to sac to spleen, everything\nshutting off, closing up forever. It was like standing by a wrecked locomotive or a steam shovel at\nquitting time, all valves being released or levered tight. Bones cracked; the tonnage of its own\nflesh, off balance, dead weight, snapped the delicate forearms, caught underneath. The meat\nsettled, quivering.\nAnother cracking sound. Overhead, a gigantic tree branch broke from its heavy mooring, fell. It\ncrashed upon the dead beast with finality.\n\"There.\" Lesperance checked his watch. \"Right on time. That's the giant tree that was scheduled\nto fall and kill this animal originally.\" He glanced at the two hunters. \"You want the trophy\npicture?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"We can't take a trophy back to the Future. The body has to stay right here where it would have\ndied originally, so the insects, birds, and bacteria can get at it, as they were intended to. Everything in balance. The body stays. But we can take a picture of you standing near it.\"\nThe two men tried to think, but gave up, shaking their heads.\nThey let themselves be led along the metal Path. They sank wearily into the Machine cushions.\nThey gazed back at the ruined Monster, the stagnating mound, where already strange reptilian\nbirds and golden insects were busy at the steaming armor. A sound on the floor of the Time\nMachine stiffened them. Eckels sat there, shivering.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said at last.\n\"Get up!\" cried Travis.\nEckels got up.\n\"Go out on that Path alone,\" said Travis. He had his rifle pointed, \"You're not coming back in the\nMachine. We're leaving you here!\"\nLesperance seized Travis's arm. \"Wait\u00ad\"\n\"Stay out of this!\" Travis shook his hand away. \"This fool nearly killed us. But it isn't that so\nmuch, no. It's his shoes! Look at them! He ran off the Path. That ruins us! We'll forfeit!\nThousands of dollars of insurance! We guarantee no one leaves the Path. He left it. Oh, the fool!\nI'll have to report to the government. They might revoke our license to travel. Who knows what\nhe's done to Time, to History!\"\n\"Take it easy, all he did was kick up some dirt.\"\n\"How do we know?\" cried Travis. \"We don't know anything! It's all a mystery! Get out of here, Eckels!\"\nEckels fumbled his shirt. \"I'll pay anything. A hundred thousand dollars!\"\nTravis glared at Eckels' checkbook and spat. \"Go out there. The Monster's next to the Path. Stick\nyour arms up to your elbows in his mouth. Then you can come back with us.\"\n\"That's unreasonable!\"\n\"The Monster's dead, you idiot. The bullets! The bullets can't be left behind. They don't belong in\nthe Past; they might change anything. Here's my knife. Dig them out!\"\nThe jungle was alive again, full of the old tremorings and bird cries. Eckels turned slowly to\nregard the primeval garbage dump, that hill of nightmares and terror. After a long time, like a\nsleepwalker he shuffled out along the Path.\nHe returned, shuddering, five minutes later, his arms soaked and red to the elbows. He held out\nhis hands. Each held a number of steel bullets. Then he fell. He lay where he fell, not moving.\n\"You didn't have to make him do that,\" said Lesperance.\n\"Didn't I? It's too early to tell.\" Travis nudged the still body. \"He'll live. Next time he won't go\nhunting game like this. Okay.\" He jerked his thumb wearily at Lesperance. \"Switch on. Let's go\nhome.\"\n1492. 1776. 1812.\nThey cleaned their hands and faces. They changed their caking shirts and pants. Eckels was up\nand around again, not speaking. Travis glared at him for a full ten minutes.\n\"Don't look at me,\" cried Eckels. \"I haven't done anything.\"\n\"Who can tell?\"\n\"Just ran off the Path, that's all, a little mud on my shoes\u00adwhat do you want me to do\u00adget down\nand pray?\"\n\"We might need it. I'm warning you, Eckels, I might kill you yet. I've got my gun ready.\"\n\"I'm innocent. I've done nothing!\"\n1999.2000.2055.\nThe Machine stopped.\n\"Get out,\" said Travis.\nThe room was there as they had left it. But not the same as they had left it. The same man sat\nbehind the same desk. But the same man did not quite sit behind the same desk. Travis looked\naround swiftly. \"Everything okay here?\" he snapped.\n\"Fine. Welcome home!\"\nTravis did not relax. He seemed to be looking through the one high window.\n\"Okay, Eckels, get out. Don't ever come back.\" Eckels could not move.\n\"You heard me,\" said Travis. \"What're you staring at?\"\nEckels stood smelling of the air, and there was a thing to the air, a chemical taint so subtle, so\nslight, that only a faint cry of his subliminal senses warned him it was there. The colors, white, grey, blue, orange, in the wall, in the furniture, in the sky beyond the window, were . . . were . . . . And there was a feel. His flesh twitched. His hands twitched. He stood drinking the oddness with\nthe pores of his body. Somewhere, someone must have been screaming one of those whistles that\nonly a dog can hear. His body screamed silence in return. Beyond this room, beyond this wall, beyond this man who was not quite the same man seated at this desk that was not quite the same\ndesk . . . lay an entire world of streets and people. What sort of world it was now, there was no\ntelling. He could feel them moving there, beyond the walls, almost, like so many chess pieces\nblown in a dry wind ....\nBut the immediate thing was the sign painted on the office wall, the same sign he had read earlier\ntoday on first entering. Somehow, the sign had changed:\nTYME SEFARI INC.\nSEFARIS TU ANY YEER EN THE PAST. YU NAIM THE ANIMALL.\nWEE TAEK YU THAIR. YU SHOOT ITT.\nEckels felt himself fall into a chair. He fumbled crazily at the thick slime on his boots. He held up\na clod of dirt, trembling, \"No, it can't be. Not a little thing like that. No!\"\nEmbedded in the mud, glistening green and gold and black, was a butterfly, very beautiful and\nvery dead.\n\"Not a little thing like that! Not a butterfly!\" cried Eckels.\nIt fell to the floor, an exquisite thing, a small thing that could upset balances and knock down a\nline of small dominoes and then big dominoes and then gigantic dominoes, all down the years\nacross Time. Eckels' mind whirled. It couldn't change things. Killing one butterfly couldn't be that\nimportant! Could it?\nHis face was cold. His mouth trembled, asking: \"Who \u00ad who won the presidential election\nyesterday?\"\nThe man behind the desk laughed. \"You joking? You know very well. Deutscher, of course! Who\nelse? Not that fool weakling Keith. We got an iron man now, a man with guts!\" The official\nstopped. \"What's wrong?\"\nEckels moaned. He dropped to his knees. He scrabbled at the golden butterfly with shaking\nfingers. \"Can't we,\" he pleaded to the world, to himself, to the officials, to the Machine, \"can't we\ntake it back, can't we make it alive again? Can't we start over? Can't we\u00ad\"\nHe did not move. Eyes shut, he waited, shivering. He heard Travis breathe loud in the room; he\nheard Travis shift his rifle, click the safety catch, and raise the weapon.\nThere was a sound of thunder.\n"

Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. \"Now look here, Bailey,\" she said, \"see here, read this,\" and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. \"Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did.\"\nBailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. \"The children have been to Florida before,\" the old lady said. \"You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.\"\nThe children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, \"If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?\" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\n\"She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day, June Star said without raising her yellow head.\n\"Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?\" the grandmother asked.\n\"I'd smack his face,\" John Wesley said.\n\"She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks,\" June Star said. \"Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.\"\n\"All right, Miss,\" the grandmother said. \"Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.\"\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of her gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops that made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.\n\"Let's go through Georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much,\" John Wesley said.\n\"If I were a little boy,\" said the grandmother, \"I wouldn't talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.\"\n\"Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,\" John Wesley said, \"and Georgia is a lousy state too.\"\n\"You said it,\" June Star said.\n\"In my time,\" said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, \"children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!\" she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. \"Wouldn't that make a picture, now?\" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.\n\"He didn't have any britches on,\" June Star said.\n\"He probably didn't have any,\" the grandmother explained. \"Little niggers in the country don't have things like we do. If I could paint, I'd paint that picture,\" she said. The children exchanged comic books.\nThe grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children's mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or fix graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. \"Look at the graveyard!\" the grandmother said, pointing it out. \"That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.\"\n\"Where's the plantation?\" John Wesley asked.\n\"Gone With the Wind,\" said the grandmother. \"Ha. Ha.\"\nWhen the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let the children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.\nThe grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T. ! This story tickled John Wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn't think it was any good. She said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentle man and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.\nThey stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY'S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY'S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A VETERAN! RED SAMMY'S YOUR MAN!\nRed Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him.\nInside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children's mother put a dime in the machine and played \"The Tennessee Waltz,\" and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.\n\"Ain't she cute?\" Red Sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. \"Would you like to come be my little girl?\"\n\"No I certainly wouldn't,\" June Star said. \"I wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a million bucks!\" and she ran back to the table.\n\"Ain't she cute?\" the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\n\"Arn't you ashamed?\" hissed the grandmother.\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people's order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. \"You can't win,\" he said. \"You can't win,\" and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. \"These days you don't know who to trust,\" he said. \"Ain't that the truth?\"\n\"People are certainly not nice like they used to be,\" said the grandmother.\n\"Two fellers come in here last week,\" Red Sammy said, \"driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked at the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?\"\n\"Because you're a good man!\" the grandmother said at once.\n\"Yes'm, I suppose so,\" Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. \"It isn't a soul in this green world of God's that you can trust,\" she said. \"And I don't count nobody out of that, not nobody,\" she repeated, looking at Red Sammy.\n\"Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that's escaped?\" asked the grandmother.\n\"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attack this place right here,\" said the woman. \"If he hears about it being here, I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . .\"\n\"That'll do,\" Red Sam said. \"Go bring these people their Co'-Colas,\" and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.\n\"A good man is hard to find,\" Red Sammy said. \"Everything is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.\"\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grandmother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis arbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. \"There was a secret:-panel in this house,\" she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, \"and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .\"\n\"Hey!\" John Wesley said. \"Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?\"\n\"We never have seen a house with a secret panel!\" June Star shrieked. \"Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!\"\n\"It's not far from here, I know,\" the grandmother said. \"It wouldn't take over twenty minutes.\"\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. \"No,\" he said.\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.\n\"All right!\" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. \"Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.\"\n\"It would be very educational for them,\" the grandmother murmured.\n\"All right,\" Bailey said, \"but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.\"\n\"The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,\" the grandmother directed. \"I marked it when we passed.\"\n\"A dirt road,\" Bailey groaned.\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\n\"You can't go inside this house,\" Bailey said. \"You don't know who lives there.\"\n\"While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window,\" John Wesley suggested.\n\"We'll all stay in the car,\" his mother said.\nThey turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.\n\"This place had better turn up in a minute,\" Bailey said, \"or I'm going to turn around.\"\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\n\"It's not much farther,\" the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing, the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, \"We've had an ACCIDENT!\" The grandmother was curled up under the dashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. \"We've had an ACCIDENT!\" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.\n\"But nobody's killed,\" June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\n\"Maybe a car will come along,\" said the children's mother hoarsely.\n\"I believe I have injured an organ,\" said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his head and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver-rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\n\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\" the children screamed.\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him all her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. \"Good afternoon,\" he said. \"I see you all had you a little spill.\"\n\"We turned over twice!\" said the grandmother.\n\"Once\", he corrected. \"We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,\" he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\n\"What you got that gun for?\" John Wesley asked. \"Whatcha gonna do with that gun?\"\n\"Lady,\" the man said to the children's mother, \"would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at.\"\n\"What are you telling US what to do for?\" June Star asked.\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. \"Come here,\" said their mother.\n\"Look here now,\" Bailey began suddenly, \"we're in a predicament! We're in . . .\"\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. \"You're The Misfit!\" she said. \"I recognized you at once!\"\n\"Yes'm,\" the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, \"but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me.\"\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\n\"Lady,\" he said, \"don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.\"\n\"You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?\" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. \"I would hate to have to,\" he said.\n\"Listen,\" the grandmother almost screamed, \"I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have common blood. I know you must come from nice people!\"\n\"Yes mam,\" he said, \"finest people in the world.\" When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. \"God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold,\" he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. \"Watch them children, Bobby Lee,\" he said. \"You know they make me nervous.\" He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say.\n\"Ain't a cloud in the sky,\" he remarked, looking up at it. \"Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither.\"\n\"Yes, it's a beautiful day,\" said the grandmother. \"Listen,\" she said, \"you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell.\"\n\"Hush!\" Bailey yelled. \"Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!\" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.\n\"I pre-chate that, lady,\" The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.\n\"It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car,\" Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.\n\"Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,\" The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. \"The boys want to ast you something,\" he said to Bailey. \"Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?\"\n\"Listen,\" Bailey began, \"we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,\" and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.\nThe grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, \"I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!\"\n\"Come back this instant!\" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.\n\"Bailey Boy!\" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. \"I just know you're a good man,\" she said desperately. \"You're not a bit common!\"\n\"Nome, I ain't a good man,\" The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, \"but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into everything!\"' He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. \"I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies,\" he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. \"We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just making do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,\" he explained.\n\"That's perfectly all right,\" the grandmother said. \"Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.\"\n\"I'll look and see terrectly,\" The Misfit said.\n\"Where are they taking him?\" the children's mother screamed.\n\"Daddy was a card himself,\" The Misfit said. \"You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.\"\n\"You could be honest too if you'd only try,\" said the grandmother. \"Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about somebody chasing you all the time.\"\nThe Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. \"Yes'm, somebody is always after you,\" he murmured.\nThe grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. \"Do you ever pray?\" she asked.\nHe shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. \"Nome,\" he said.\nThere was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied in-suck of breath. \"Bailey Boy!\" she called.\n\"I was a gospel singer for a while,\" The Misfit said. \"I been most everything. Been in the arm service both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,\" and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; \"I even seen a woman flogged,\" he said.\n\"Pray, pray,\" the grandmother began, \"pray, pray . . .\"\n\"I never was a bad boy that I remember of,\" The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, \"but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,\" and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\n\"That's when you should have started to pray,\" she said. \"What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?\"\n\"Turn to the right, it was a wall,\" The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. \"Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain't recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.\"\n\"Maybe they put you in by mistake,\" the old lady said vaguely.\n\"Nome,\" he said. \"It wasn't no mistake. They had the papers on me.\"\n\"You must have stolen something,\" she said.\nThe Misfit sneered slightly. \"Nobody had nothing I wanted,\" he said. \"It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.\"\n\"If you would pray,\" the old lady said, \"Jesus would help you.\"\n\"That's right,\" The Misfit said.\n\"Well then, why don't you pray?\" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.\n\"I don't want no hep,\" he said. \"I'm doing all right by myself.\"\nBobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.\n\"Throw me that shirt, Bobby Lee,\" The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. \"No, lady,\" The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, \"I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.\"\nThe children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. \"Lady,\" he asked, \"would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?\"\n\"Yes, thank you,\" the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. \"Hep that lady up, Hiram,\" The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, \"and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand.\"\n\"I don't want to hold hands with him,\" June Star said. \"He reminds me of a pig.\"\nThe fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.\nAlone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, \"Jesus. Jesus,\" meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.\n\"Yes'm, The Misfit said as if he agreed. \"Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,\" he said, \"they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,\" he said, \"because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.\"\nThere was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report.\n\"Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?\"\n\"Jesus!\" the old lady cried. \"You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!\"\n\"Lady,\" The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, \"there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.\"\nThere were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, \"Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!\" as if her heart would break.\n\"Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,\" The Misfit continued, \"and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,\" he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.\n\"Maybe He didn't raise the dead,\" the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.\n\"I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't,\" The Misfit said. \"I wisht I had of been there,\" he said, hitting the ground with his fist. \"It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,\" he said in a high voice, \"if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now.\"\nHis voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. She saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, \"Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children !\" She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.\nHiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.\nWithout his glasses, The Misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. \"Take her off and throw her where you thrown the others,\" he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.\n\"She was a talker, wasn't she?\" Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.\n\"She would of been a good woman,\" The Misfit said, \"if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\"\n\"Some fun!\" Bobby Lee said.\n\"Shut up, Bobby Lee,\" The Misfit said. \"It's no real pleasure in life.\"\n"

So was old age.\nDeath, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.\nThe population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls.\nOne bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr.,\nwaited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day\nany more.\nWehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and\ntwenty-nine.\nX-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first.\nYoung Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and\ncolorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a\ndisorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls.\nThe floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.\nThe room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had\nvolunteered to die.\nA sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder, painting a mural he did not\nlike. Back in the days when people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five\nor so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.\nThe mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women in white, doctors\nand nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.\nMen and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly,\nraked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.\n2\nNever, never, never\u2014not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan\u2014had a garden been more\nformal, been better tended. Every plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it\ncould use.\nA hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a popular song:\nIf you don't like my kisses, honey,\nHere's what I will do:\nI'll go see a girl in purple,\nKiss this sad world toodle-oo.\nIf you don't want my lovin',\nWhy should I take up all this space?\nI'll get off this old planet,\nLet some sweet baby have my place.\nThe orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. \"Looks so real,\" he said, \"I can practically\nimagine I'm standing in the middle of it.\"\n\"What makes you think you're not in it?\" said the painter. He gave a satiric smile. \"It's called\n'The Happy Garden of Life,' you know.\"\n\"That's good of Dr. Hitz,\" said the orderly.\nHe was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin\nHitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Hitz was a blindingly handsome man.\n\"Lot of faces still to fill in,\" said the orderly. He meant that the faces of many of the figures in\nthe mural were still blank. All blanks were to be filled with portraits of important people on\neither the hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Termination.\n\"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,\" said the orderly.\nThe painter's face curdled with scorn. \"You think I'm proud of this daub?\" he said. \"You think\nthis is my idea of what life really looks like?\"\n\"What's your idea of what life looks like?\" said the orderly.\nThe painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. \"There's a good picture of it,\" he said. \"Frame that, and\nyou'll have a picture a damn sight more honest than this one.\"\n\"You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?\" said the orderly.\n\"Is that a crime?\" said the painter.\nThe orderly shrugged. \"If you don't like it here, Grandpa\u2014\" he said, and he finished the thought\nwith the trick telephone number that people who didn't want to live any more were supposed to\ncall. The zero in the telephone number he pronounced \"naught.\"\n3\nThe number was: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"\nIt was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets included: \"Automat,\"\n\"Birdland,\" \"Cannery,\" \"Catbox,\" \"De-louser,\" \"Easy-go,\" \"Good-by, Mother,\" \"Happy\nHooligan,\" \"Kiss-me-quick,\" \"Lucky Pierre,\" \"Sheepdip,\" \"Waring Blendor,\" \"Weep-no-more\"\nand \"Why Worry?\"\n\"To be or not to be\" was the telephone number of the municipal gas chambers of the Federal\nBureau of Termination.\nThe painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. \"When I decide it's time to go,\" he said, \"it won't be\nat the Sheepdip.\"\n\"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?\" said the orderly. \"Messy business, Grandpa. Why don't you have a little\nconsideration for the people who have to clean up after you?\"\nThe painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the tribulations of his survivors.\n\"The world could do with a good deal more mess, if you ask me,\" he said.\nThe orderly laughed and moved on.\nWehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head. And then he fell silent\nagain.\nA coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings,\ntrench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple, the purple the painter called \"the color of\ngrapes on Judgment Day.\"\nThe medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service Division of the Federal\nBureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a turnstile.\nThe woman had a lot of facial hair\u2014an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A curious thing about\ngas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely and feminine they were when recruited,\nthey all sprouted mustaches within five years or so.\n\"Is this where I'm supposed to come?\" she said to the painter.\n\"A lot would depend on what your business was,\" he said. \"You aren't about to have a baby, are\nyou?\"\n\"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,\" she said. \"My name's Leora Duncan.\"\nShe waited.\n\"And you dunk people,\" he said.\n\"What?\" she said.\n\"Skip it,\" he said.\n4\n\"That sure is a beautiful picture,\" she said. \"Looks just like heaven or something.\"\n\"Or something,\" said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock pocket. \"Duncan,\nDuncan, Duncan,\" he said, scanning the list. \"Yes\u2014here you are. You're entitled to be\nimmortalized. See any faceless body here you'd like me to stick your head on? We've got a few\nchoice ones left.\"\nShe studied the mural bleakly. \"Gee,\" she said, \"they're all the same to me. I don't know anything\nabout art.\"\n\"A body's a body, eh?\" he said, \"All righty. As a master of fine art, I recommend this body here.\"\nHe indicated a faceless figure of a woman who was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.\n\"Well,\" said Leora Duncan, \"that's more the disposal people, isn't it? I mean, I'm in service. I\ndon't do any disposing.\"\nThe painter clapped his hands in mock delight. \"You say you don't know anything about art, and\nthen you prove in the next breath that you know more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-\ncarrier is wrong for a hostess! A snipper, a pruner\u2014that's more your line.\" He pointed to a figure\nin purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. \"How about her?\" he said. \"You like\nher at all?\"\n\"Gosh\u2014\" she said, and she blushed and became humble\u2014\"that\u2014that puts me right next to Dr.\nHitz.\"\n\"That upsets you?\" he said.\n\"Good gravy, no!\" she said. \"It's\u2014it's just such an honor.\"\n\"Ah, You admire him, eh?\" he said.\n\"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It was the portrait of a\ntanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred and forty years old. \"Who doesn't admire\nhim?\" she said again. \"He was responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago.\"\n\"Nothing would please me more,\" said the painter, \"than to put you next to him for all time.\nSawing off a limb\u2014that strikes you as appropriate?\"\n\"That is kind of like what I do,\" she said. She was demure about what she did. What she did was\nmake people comfortable while she killed them.\nAnd, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz\nhimself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy\nof living.\n\"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!\" he said, and he made a joke. \"What are you doing here?\" he\nsaid. \"This isn't where the people leave. This is where they come in!\"\n5\n\"We're going to be in the same picture together,\" she said shyly.\n\"Good!\" said Dr. Hitz heartily. \"And, say, isn't that some picture?\"\n\"I sure am honored to be in it with you,\" she said.\n\"Let me tell you,\" he said, \"I'm honored to be in it with you. Without women like you, this\nwonderful world we've got wouldn't be possible.\"\nHe saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms. \"Guess what was just\nborn,\" he said.\n\"I can't,\" she said.\n\"Triplets!\" he said.\n\"Triplets!\" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets.\nThe law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find\nsomeone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers.\n\"Do the parents have three volunteers?\" said Leora Duncan.\n\"Last I heard,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"they had one, and were trying to scrape another two up.\"\n\"I don't think they made it,\" she said. \"Nobody made three appointments with us. Nothing but\nsingles going through today, unless somebody called in after I left. What's the name?\"\n\"Wehling,\" said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy. \"Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is\nthe name of the happy father-to-be.\"\nHe raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a hoarsely wretched chuckle.\n\"Present,\" he said.\n\"Oh, Mr. Wehling,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"I didn't see you.\"\n\"The invisible man,\" said Wehling.\n\"They just phoned me that your triplets have been born,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"They're all fine, and so\nis the mother. I'm on my way in to see them now.\"\n\"Hooray,\" said Wehling emptily.\n\"You don't sound very happy,\" said Dr. Hitz.\n\"What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?\" said Wehling. He gestured with his hands to\nsymbolize care-free simplicity. \"All I have to do is pick out which one of the triplets is going to\nlive, then deliver my maternal grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a\nreceipt.\"\n6\nDr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. \"You don't believe in population\ncontrol, Mr. Wehling?\" he said.\n\"I think it's perfectly keen,\" said Wehling tautly.\n\"Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of the Earth was twenty\nbillion\u2014about to become forty billion, then eighty billion, then one hundred and sixty billion?\nDo you know what a drupelet is, Mr. Wehling?\" said Hitz.\n\"Nope,\" said Wehling sulkily.\n\"A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little pulpy grains of a\nblackberry,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Without population control, human beings would now be packed on\nthis surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!\"\nWehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.\n\"In the year 2000,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"before scientists stepped in and laid down the law, there\nwasn't even enough drinking water to go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weed\u2014and still\npeople insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to live\nforever.\"\n\"I want those kids,\" said Wehling quietly. \"I want all three of them.\"\n\"Of course you do,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"That's only human.\"\n\"I don't want my grandfather to die, either,\" said Wehling.\n\"Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,\" said Dr. Hitz gently,\nsympathetically.\n\"I wish people wouldn't call it that,\" said Leora Duncan.\n\"What?\" said Dr. Hitz.\n\"I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like that,\" she said. \"It gives people the\nwrong impression.\"\n\"You're absolutely right,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Forgive me.\" He corrected himself, gave the municipal\ngas chambers their official title, a title no one ever used in conversation. \"I should have said,\n'Ethical Suicide Studios,'\" he said.\n\"That sounds so much better,\" said Leora Duncan.\n\"This child of yours\u2014whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"He or\nshe is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet, thanks to population control. In a\ngarden like that mural there.\" He shook his head. \"Two centuries ago, when I was a young man,\nit was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now centuries of peace and\nplenty stretch before us as far as the imagination cares to travel.\"\nHe smiled luminously.\nThe smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver.\n7\nWehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. \"There's room for one\u2014a great big one,\" he said.\nAnd then he shot Leora Duncan. \"It's only death,\" he said to her as she fell. \"There! Room for\ntwo.\"\nAnd then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children.\nNobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.\nThe painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively on the sorry scene.\nThe painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born and, once born,\ndemanding to be fruitful ... to multiply and to live as long as possible\u2014to do all that on a very\nsmall planet that would have to last forever.\nAll the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer, surely, than a Catbox, a\nHappy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war. He thought of plague. He thought of\nstarvation.\nHe knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to the drop-cloths below.\nAnd then he decided he had had about enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he\ncame slowly down from the ladder.\nHe took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.\nBut he didn't have the nerve.\nAnd then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went to it, dialed the well-\nremembered number: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"\n\"Federal Bureau of Termination,\" said the very warm voice of a hostess.\n\"How soon could I get an appointment?\" he asked, speaking very carefully.\n\"We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,\" she said. \"It might even be earlier, if we\nget a cancellation.\"\n\"All right,\" said the painter, \"fit me in, if you please.\" And he gave her his name, spelling it out.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the hostess. \"Your city thanks you; your country thanks you; your planet\nthanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is from future generations.\"\n"

                "content": "\nIt is thousands, perhaps millions of years since Sir John explained to me. What little I understood at the time I may have forgotten, yet I try to reproduce what I can of his theory.\n\"In my study of the processes of birth,\" he began, \"I discovered the rudiments of an action which takes place in the bodies of both men and women. There are certain properties in the foods we eat that remain in the body for the reproduction of life, two distinct Essences, so to speak, of which one is retained by the woman, another by the man. It is the union of these two properties that, of course, creates the child.\n\"Now, I made a slight mistake one day in experimenting with a guinea-pig, and I re-arranged certain organs which I need not describe so that I thought I had completely messed up the poor creature's abdomen. It lived, however, and I laid it aside. It was some years later that I happened to notice it again. It had not given birth to any young, but I was amazed to note that it had apparently grown no older: it seemed precisely in the same state of growth in which I had left it.\n\"From that I built up. I re-examined the guinea-pig, and observed it carefully. I need not detail my studies. But in the end I found that my 'mistake' had in reality been a momentous discovery. I found that I had only to close certain organs, to re-arrange certain ducts, and to open certain dormant organs, and, mirabile dictu, the whole process of reproduction was changed.\n\"You have heard, of course, that our bodies are continually changing, hour by hour, minute by minute, so that every few years we have been literally reborn. Some such principle as this seems to operate in reproduction, except that, instead of the old body being replaced by the new, and in its form, approximately, the new body is created apart from it. It is the creation of children that causes us to die, it would seem, because if this activity is, so to speak, dammed up or turned aside into new channels, the reproduction operates on the old body, renewing it continually. It is very obscure and very absurd, is it not? But the most absurd part of it is that it is true. Whatever the true explanation may be, the fact remains that the operation can be done, that it actually prolongs life indefinitely, and that I alone know the secret.\"\nSir John told me a very great deal more, but, after all, I think it amounted to little more than this. It would be impossible for me to express the great hold his discovery took upon my mind the moment he recounted it. From the very first, under the spell of his personality, I believed, and I knew he was speaking the truth. And it opened up before me new vistas. I began to see myself become suddenly eternal, never again to know the fear of death. I could see myself storing up, century after century, an amplitude of wisdom and experience that would make me truly a god.\n\"Sir John!\" I cried, long before he was finished. \"You must perform that operation on me!\"\n\"But, Dennell, you are too hasty. You must not put yourself so rashly into my hands.\"\n\"You have perfected the operation, haven't you?\"\n\"That is true,\" he said.\n\"You must try it out on somebody, must you not?\"\n\"Yes, of course. And yet\u2014somehow, Dennell, I am afraid. I cannot help feeling that man is not yet prepared for such a vast thing. There are sacrifices. One must give up love and all sensual pleasure. This operation not only takes away the mere fact of reproduction, but it deprives one of all the things that go with sex, all love, all sense of beauty, all feeling for poetry and the arts. It leaves only the few emotions, selfish emotions, that are necessary to self-preservation. Do you not see? One becomes an intellect, nothing more\u2014a cold apotheosis of reason. And I, for one, cannot face such a thing calmly.\"\n\"But, Sir John, like many fears, it is largely horrible in the foresight. After you have changed your nature you cannot regret it. What you are would be as horrible an idea to you afterwards as the thought of what you will be seems now.\"\n\"True, true. I know it. But it is hard to face, nevertheless.\"\n\"I am not afraid to face it.\"\n\"You do not understand it, Dennell, I am afraid. And I wonder whether you or I or any of us on this earth are ready for such a step. After all, to make a race deathless, one should be sure it is a perfect race.\"\n\"Sir John,\" I said, \"it is not you who have to face this, nor any one else in the world till you are ready. But I am firmly resolved, and I demand it of you as my friend.\"\nWell, we argued much further, but in the end I won. Sir John promised to perform the operation three days later.\n... But do you perceive now what I had forgotten during all that discussion, the one thing I had thought I could never forget so long as I lived, not even for an instant? It was my love for Alice\u2014I had forgotten that!\nI cannot write here all the infinity of emotions I experienced later, when, with Alice in my arms, it suddenly came upon me what I had done. Ages ago\u2014I have forgotten how to feel. I could name now a thousand feelings I used to have, but I can no longer even understand them. For only the heart can understand the heart, and the intellect only the intellect.\nWith Alice in my arms, I told the whole story. It was she who, with her quick instinct, grasped what I had never noticed.\n\"But Carl!\" she cried, \"Don't you see?\u2014It will mean that we can never be married!\" And, for the first time, I understood. If only I could re-capture some conception of that love! I have always known, since the last shred of comprehension slipped from me, that I lost something very wonderful when I lost love. But what does it matter? I lost Alice too, and I could not have known love again without her.\nWe were very sad and very tragic that night. For hours and hours we argued the question over. But I felt somewhat that I was inextricably caught in my fate, that I could not retreat now from my resolve. I was perhaps, very school-boyish, but I felt that it would be cowardice to back out now. But it was Alice again who perceived a final aspect of the matter.\n\"Carl,\" she said to me, her lips very close to mine, \"it need not come between our love. After all, ours would be a poor sort of love if it were not more of the mind than of the flesh. We shall remain lovers, but we shall forget mere carnal desire. I shall submit to that operation too!\"\nAnd I could not shake her from her resolve. I would speak of danger that I could not let her face. But, after the fashion of women, she disarmed me with the accusation that I did not love her, that I did not want her love, that I was trying to escape from love. What answer had I for that, but that I loved her and would do anything in the world not to lose her?\nI have wondered sometimes since whether we might have known the love of the mind. Is love something entirely of the flesh, something created by an ironic God merely to propagate His race? Or can there be love without emotion, love without passion\u2014love between two cold intellects? I do not know. I did not ask then. I accepted anything that would make our way more easy.\nThere is no need to draw out the tale. Already my hand wavers, and my time grows short. Soon there will be no more of me, no more of my tale\u2014no more of Mankind. There will be only the snow, and the ice, and the cold ...\nThree days later I entered John's Hospital with Alice on my arm. All my affairs\u2014and they were few enough\u2014were in order. I had insisted that Alice wait until I had come safely through the operation, before she submitted to it. I had been carefully starved for two days, and I was lost in an unreal world of white walls and white clothes and white lights, drunk with my dreams of the future. When I was wheeled into the operating room on the long, hard table, for a moment it shone with brilliant distinctness, a neat, methodical white chamber, tall and more or less circular. Then I was beneath the glare of soft white lights, and the room faded into a misty vagueness from which little steel rays flashed and quivered from silvery cold instruments. For a moment our hands, Sir John's and mine, gripped, and we were saying good-bye\u2014for a little while\u2014in the way men say these things. Then I felt the warm touch of Alice's lips upon mine, and I felt sudden painful things I cannot describe, that I could not have described then. For a moment I felt that I must rise and cry out that I could not do it. But the feeling passed, and I was passive.\nSomething was pressed about my mouth and nose, something with an ethereal smell. Staring eyes swam about me from behind their white masks. I struggled instinctively, but in vain\u2014I was held securely. Infinitesimal points of light began to wave back and forth on a pitch-black background; a great hollow buzzing echoed in my head. My head seemed suddenly to have become all throat, a great, cavernous, empty throat in which sounds and lights were mingled together, in a swift rhythm, approaching, receding eternally. Then, I think, there were dreams. But I have forgotten them....\nI began to emerge from the effect of the ether. Everything was dim, but I could perceive Alice beside me, and Sir John.\n\"Bravely done!\" Sir John was saying, and Alice, too, was saying something, but I cannot remember what. For a long while we talked, I speaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether, they teasing me a little solemnly. But after a little while I became aware of the fact that they were about to leave. Suddenly, God knows why, I knew that they must not leave. Something cried in the back of my head that they must stay\u2014one cannot explain these things, except by after events. I began to press them to remain, but they smiled and said they must get their dinner. I commanded them not to go; but they spoke kindly and said they would be back before long. I think I even wept a little, like a child, but Sir John said something to the nurse, who began to reason with me firmly, and then they were gone, and somehow I was asleep....\nWhen I awoke again, my head was fairly clear, but there was an abominable reek of ether all about me. The moment I opened my eyes, I felt that something had happened. I asked for Sir John and for Alice. I saw a swift, curious look that I could not interpret come over the face of the nurse, then she was calm again, her countenance impassive. She reassured me in quick meaningless phrases, and told me to sleep. But I could not sleep: I was absolutely sure that something had happened to them, to my friend and to the woman I loved. Yet all my insistence profited me nothing, for the nurses were a silent lot. Finally, I think, they must have given me a sleeping potion of some sort, for I fell asleep again.\nFor two endless, chaotic days, I saw nothing of either of them, Alice or Sir John. I became more and more agitated, the nurse more and more taciturn. She would only say that they had gone away for a day or two.\nAnd then, on the third day, I found out. They thought I was asleep. The night nurse had just come in to relieve the other.\n\"Has he been asking about them again?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, poor fellow. I have hardly managed to keep him quiet.\"\n\"We will have to keep it from him until he is recovered fully.\" There was a long pause, and I could hardly control my labored breathing.\n\"How sudden it was!\" one of them said. \"To be killed like that\u2014\" I heard no more, for I leapt suddenly up in bed, crying out.\n\"Quick! For God's sake, tell me what has happened!\" I jumped to the floor and seized one of them by the collar. She was horrified. I shook her with a superhuman strength.\n\"Tell me!\" I shouted, \"Tell me\u2014Or I'll\u2014!\" She told me\u2014what else could she do.\n\"They were killed in an accident,\" she gasped, \"in a taxi\u2014a collision\u2014the Strand\u2014!\" And at that moment a crowd of nurses and attendants arrived, called by the other frantic woman, and they put me to bed again.\nI have no memory of the next few days. I was in delirium, and I was never told what I said during my ravings. Nor can I express the feelings I was saturated with when at last I regained my mind again. Between my old emotions and any attempt to put them into words, or even to remember them, lies always that insurmountable wall of my Change. I cannot understand what I must have felt, I cannot express it.\nI only know that for weeks I was sunk in a misery beyond any misery I had ever imagined before. The only two friends I had on earth were gone to me. I was left alone. And, for the first time, I began to see before me all these endless years that would be the same, dull, lonely.\nYet I recovered. I could feel each day the growth of a strange new vigor in my limbs, a vast force that was something tangibly expressive to eternal life. Slowly my anguish began to die. After a week more, I began to understand how my emotions were leaving me, how love and beauty and everything of which poetry was made\u2014how all this was going. I could not bear the thought at first. I would look at the golden sunlight and the blue shadow of the wind, and I would say,\n\"God! How beautiful!\" And the words would echo meaninglessly in my ears. Or I would remember Alice's face, that face I had once loved so inextinguishably, and I would weep and clutch my forehead, and clench my fists, crying,\n\"O God, how can I live without her!\" Yet there would be a little strange fancy in my head at the same moment, saying,\n\"Who is this Alice? You know no such person.\" And truly I would wonder whether she had ever existed.\nSo, slowly, the old emotions were shed away from me, and I began to joy in a corresponding growth of my mental perceptions. I began to toy idly with mathematical formulae I had forgotten years ago, in the same fashion that a poet toys with a word and its shades of meaning. I would look at everything with new, seeing eyes, new perception, and I would understand things I had never understood before, because formerly my emotions had always occupied me more than my thoughts.\nAnd so the weeks went by, until, one day, I was well.\n... What, after all, is the use of this chronicle? Surely there will never be men to read it. I have heard them say that the snow will never go. I will be buried, it will be buried with me; and it will be the end of us both. Yet, somehow, it eases my weary soul a little to write....\nNeed I say that I lived, thereafter, many thousands of thousands of years, until this day? I cannot detail that life. It is a long round of new, fantastic impressions, coming dream-like, one after another, melting into each other. In looking back, as in looking back upon dreams, I seem to recall only a few isolated periods clearly; and it seems that my imagination must have filled in the swift movement between episodes. I think now, of necessity, in terms of centuries and millenniums, rather than days and months.... The snow blows terribly about my little fire, and I know it will soon gather courage to quench us both ...\nYears passed, at first with a sort of clear wonder. I watched things that took place everywhere in the world. I studied. The other students were much amazed to see me, a man of thirty odd, coming back to college.\n\"But Judas, Dennell, you've already got your Ph.D! What more do you want?\" So they would all ask me. And I would reply;\n\"I want an M.D. and an F.R.C.S.\" I didn't tell them that I wanted degrees in Law, too, and in Biology and Chemistry, in Architecture and Engineering, in Psychology and Philosophy. Even so, I believe they thought me mad. But poor fools! I would think. They can hardly realize that I have all of eternity before me to study.\nI went to school for many decades. I would pass from University to University, leisurely gathering all the fruits of every subject I took up, revelling in study as no student revelled ever before. There was no need of hurry in my life, no fear of death too soon. There was a magnificence of vigor in my body, and a magnificence of vision and clarity in my brain. I felt myself a super-man. I had only to go on storing up wisdom until the day should come when all knowledge of the world was mine, and then I could command the world. I had no need for hurry. O vast life! How I gloried in my eternity! And how little good it has ever done me, by the irony of God.\nFor several centuries, changing my name and passing from place to place, I continued my studies. I had no consciousness of monotony, for, to the intellect, monotony cannot exist: it was one of those emotions I had left behind. One day, however, in the year 2132, a great discovery was made by a man called Zarentzov. It had to do with the curvature of space, quite changing the conceptions that we had all followed since Einstein. I had long ago mastered the last detail of Einstein's theory, as had, in time, the rest of the world. I threw myself immediately into the study of this new, epoch-making conception.\nTo my amazement, it all seemed to me curiously dim and elusive. I could not quite grasp what Zarentzov was trying to formulate.\n\"Why,\" I cried, \"the thing is a monstrous fraud!\" I went to the professor of Physics in the University I then attended, and I told him it was a fraud, a huge book of mere nonsense. He looked at me rather pityingly.\n\"I am afraid, Modevski,\" he said, addressing me by the name I was at the time using, \"I am afraid you do not understand it, that is all. When your mind has broadened, you will. You should apply yourself more carefully to your Physics.\" But that angered me, for I had mastered my Physics before he was ever born. I challenged him to explain the theory. And he did! He put it, obviously, in the clearest language he could. Yet I understood nothing. I stared at him dumbly, until he shook his head impatiently, saying that it was useless, that if I could not grasp it I would simply have to keep on studying. I was stunned. I wandered away in a daze.\nFor do you see what happened? During all those years I had studied ceaselessly, and my mind had been clear and quick as the day I first had left the hospital. But all that time I had been able only to remain what I was\u2014an extraordinarily intelligent man of the twentieth century. And the rest of the race had been progressing! It had been swiftly gathering knowledge and power and ability all that time, faster and faster, while I had been only remaining still. And now here was Zarentzov and the teachers of the Universities, and, probably, a hundred intelligent men, who had all outstripped me! I was being left behind.\nAnd that is what happened. I need not dilate further upon it. By the end of that century I had been left behind by all the students of the world, and I never did understand Zarentzov. Other men came with other theories, and these theories were accepted by the world. But I could not understand them. My intellectual life was at an end. I had nothing more to understand. I knew everything I was capable of knowing, and, thenceforth, I could only play wearily with the old ideas.\nMany things happened in the world. A time came when the East and West, two mighty unified hemispheres, rose up in arms: the civil war of a planet. I recall only chaotic visions of fire and thunder and hell. It was all incomprehensible to me: like a bizarre dream, things happened, people rushed about, but I never knew what they were doing. I lurked during all that time in a tiny shuddering hole under the city of Yokohama, and by a miracle I survived. And the East won. But it seems to have mattered little who did win, for all the world had become, in all except its few remaining prejudices, a single race, and nothing was changed when it was all rebuilt again, under a single government.\nI saw the first of the strange creatures who appeared among us in the year 6371, men who were later known to be from the planet Venus. But they were repulsed, for they were savages compared with the Earthmen, although they were about equal to the people of my own century, 1900. Those of them who did not perish of the cold after the intense warmth of their world, and those who were not killed by our hands, those few returned silently home again. And I have always regretted that I had not the courage to go with them.\nI watched a time when the world reached perfection in mechanics, when men could accomplish anything with a touch of the finger. Strange men, these creatures of the hundredth century, men with huge brains and tiny shriveled bodies, atrophied limbs, and slow, ponderous movements on their little conveyances. It was I, with my ancient compunctions, who shuddered when at last they put to death all the perverts, the criminals, and the insane, ridding the world of the scum for which they had no more need. It was then that I was forced to produce my tattered old papers, proving my identity and my story. They knew it was true, in some strange fashion of theirs, and, thereafter, I was kept on exhibition as an archaic survival.\nI saw the world made immortal through the new invention of a man called Kathol, who used somewhat the same method \"legend\" decreed had been used upon me. I observed the end of speech, of all perceptions except one, when men learned to communicate directly by thought, and to receive directly into the brain all the myriad vibrations of the universe.\nAll these things I saw, and more, until that time when there was no more discovery, but a Perfect World in which there was no need for anything but memory. Men ceased to count time at last. Several hundred years after the 154th Dynasty from the Last War, or, as we would have counted in my time, about 200,000 A.D., official records of time were no longer kept carefully. They fell into disuse. Men began to forget years, to forget time at all. Of what significance was time when one was immortal?\nAfter long, long uncounted centuries, a time came when the days grew noticeably colder. Slowly the winters became longer, and the summers diminished to but a month or two. Fierce storms raged endlessly in winter, and in summer sometimes there was severe frost, sometimes there was only frost. In the high places and in the north and the sub-equatorial south, the snow came and would not go.\nMen died by the thousands in the higher latitudes. New York became, after awhile, the furthest habitable city north, an arctic city, where warmth seldom penetrated. And great fields of ice began to make their way southward, grinding before them the brittle remains of civilizations, covering over relentlessly all of man's proud work.\nSnow appeared in Florida and Italy one summer. In the end, snow was there always. Men left New York, Chicago, Paris, Yokohama, and everywhere they traveled by the millions southward, perishing as they went, pursued by the snow and the cold, and that inevitable field of ice. They were feeble creatures when the Cold first came upon them, but I speak in terms of thousands of years; and they turned every weapon of science to the recovery of their physical power, for they foresaw that the only chance for survival lay in a hard, strong body. As for me, at last I had found a use for my few powers, for my physique was the finest in that world. It was but little comfort, however, for we were all united in our awful fear of that Cold and that grinding field of Ice. All the great cities were deserted. We would catch silent, fearful glimpses of them as we sped on in our machines over the snow\u2014great hungry, haggard skeletons of cities, shrouded in banks of snow, snow that the wind rustled through desolate streets where the cream of human life once had passed in calm security. Yet still the Ice pursued. For men had forgotten about that Last Ice Age when they ceased to reckon time, when they lost sight of the future and steeped themselves in memories. They had not remembered that a time must come when Ice would lie white and smooth over all the earth, when the sun would shine bleakly between unending intervals of dim, twilight snow and sleet.\nSlowly the Ice pursued us down the earth, until all the feeble remains of civilization were gathered in Egypt and India and South America. The deserts flowered again, but the frost would come always to bite the tiny crops. For still the Ice came. All the world now, but for a narrow strip about the equator, was one great silent desolate vista of stark ice-plains, ice that brooded above the hidden ruins of cities that had endured for hundreds of thousands of years. It was terrible to imagine the awful solitude and the endless twilight that lay on these places, and the grim snow, sailing in silence over all....\nIt surrounded us on all sides, until life remained only in a few scattered clearings all about that equator of the globe, with an eternal fire going to hold away the hungry Ice. Perpetual winter reigned now; and we were becoming terror-stricken beasts that preyed on each other for a life already doomed. Ah, but I, I the archaic survival, I had my revenge then, with my great physique and strong jaws\u2014God! Let me think of something else. Those men who lived upon each other\u2014it was horrible. And I was one.\nSo inevitably the Ice closed in.... One day the men of our tiny clearing were but a score. We huddled about our dying fire of bones and stray logs. We said nothing. We just sat, in deep, wordless, thoughtless silence. We were the last outpost of Mankind.\nI think suddenly something very noble must have transformed these creatures to a semblance of what they had been of old. I saw, in their eyes, the question they sent from one to another, and in every eye I saw that the answer was, Yes. With one accord they rose before my eyes and, ignoring me as a baser creature, they stripped away their load of tattered rags and, one by one, they stalked with their tiny shrivelled limbs into the shivering gale of swirling, gusting snow, and disappeared. And I was alone....\nSo am I alone now. I have written this last fantastic history of myself and of Mankind upon a substance that will, I know, outlast even the snow and the Ice\u2014as it has outlasted Mankind that made it. It is the only thing with which I have never parted. For is it not irony that I should be the historian of this race\u2014I, a savage, an \"archaic survival?\" Why do I write? God knows, but some instinct prompts me, although there will never be men to read.\nI have been sitting here, waiting, and I have thought often of Sir John and Alice, whom I loved. Can it be that I am feeling again, after all these ages, some tiny portion of that emotion, that great passion I once knew? I see her face before me, the face I have lost from my thoughts for eons, and something is in it that stirs my blood again. Her eyes are half-closed and deep, her lips are parted as though I could crush them with an infinity of wonder and discovery. O God! It is love again, love that I thought was lost! They have often smiled upon me when I spoke of God, and muttered about my foolish, primitive superstitions. But they are gone, and I am left who believe in God, and surely there is purpose in it.\nI am cold, I have written. Ah, I am frozen. My breath freezes as it mingles with the air, and I can hardly move my numbed fingers. The Ice is closing over me, and I cannot break it any longer. The storm cries weirdly all about me in the twilight, and I know this is the end. The end of the world. And I\u2014I, the last man....\nThe last man....\n... I am cold\u2014cold....\nBut is it you, Alice? Is it you?\n"

                "content": "\nAnders couldn't get to the bank until just before it closed, so of course the line was endless and he got stuck behind two women whose loud, stupid conversation put him in a murderous temper. He was never in the best of tempers anyway, Anders - a book critic known for the weary, elegant savagery with which he dispatched almost everything he reviewed.\nWith the line still doubled around the rope, one of the tellers stuck a \"POSITION CLOSED\" sign in her window and walked to the back of the bank, where she leaned against a desk and began to pass the time with a man shuffling papers. The women in front of Anders broke off their conversation and watched the teller with hatred. \"Oh, that's nice,\" one of them said. She turned to Anders and added, confident of his accord, \"One of those little human touches that keep us coming back for more.\"\nAnders had conceived his own towering hatred of the teller, but he immediately turned it on the presumptuous crybaby in front of him. \"Damned unfair,\" he said. \"Tragic, really. If they're not chopping off the wrong leg, or bombing your ancestral village, they're closing their positions.\"\nShe stood her ground. \"I didn't say it was tragic,\" she said. \"I just think it's a pretty lousy way to treat your customers.\"\n\"Unforgivable,\" Anders said. \"Heaven will take note.\"\nShe sucked in her cheeks but stared past him and said nothing. Anders saw that the other woman, her friend, was looking in the same direction. And then the tellers stopped what they were doing, and the customers slowly turned, and silence came over the bank. Two men wearing black ski masks and blue business suits were standing to the side of the door. One of them had a pistol pressed against the guard's neck. The guard's eyes were closed, and his lips were moving. The other man had a sawed-off shotgun. \"Keep your big mouth shut!\" the man with the pistol said, though no one had spoken a word. \"One of you tellers hits the alarm, you're all dead meat. Got it?\"\nThe tellers nodded.\n\"Oh, bravo, \" Anders said. \"Dead meat.\" He turned to the woman in front of him. \"Great script, eh? The stern, brass-knuckled poetry of the dangerous classes.\"\nShe looked at him with drowning eyes.\nThe man with the shotgun pushed the guard to his knees. He handed up the shotgun to his partner and yanked the guard's wrists up behind his back and locked them together with a pair of handcuffs. He toppled him onto the floor with a kick between the shoulder blades. Then he took his shotgun back and went over to the security gate at the end of the counter. He was short and heavy and moved with peculiar slowness, even torpor. \"Buzz him in,\" his partner said. The man with the shotgun opened the gate and sauntered along the line of tellers, handing each of them a Hefty bag. When he came to the empty position he looked over at the man with the pistol, who said, \"Whose slot is that?\"\nAnders watched the teller. She put her hand to her throat and turned to the man she'd been talking to. He nodded. \"Mine,\" she said.\n\"Then get your ugly ass in gear and fill that bag.\"\n\"There you go,\" Anders said to the woman in front of him. \"Justice is done.\"\n\"Hey! Bright boy! Did I tell you talk?\"\n\"No,\" Anders said.\n\"Then shut your trap.\"\n\"Did you hear that?\" Anders said. \"'Bright boy.' Right out of 'The Killers'.\"\n\"Please be quiet,\" the woman said.\n\"Hey, you deaf or what?\" The man with the pistol walked over to Anders. He poked the weapon into Anders' gut. \"You think I'm playing games?'\n\"No,\" Anders said, but the barrel tickled like a stiff finger and he had to fight back the titters. He did this by making himself stare into the man's eyes, which were clearly visible behind the holes in the mask: pale blue, and rawly red-rimmed. The man's left eyelid kept twitching. He breathed out a piercing, ammoniac smell that shocked Anders more than anything that had happened, and he was beginning to develop a sense of unease when the man prodded him again with the pistol.\n\"You like me, bright boy?\" he said. \"You want to suck my dick?\"\n\"No,\" Anders said.\n\"Then stop looking at me.\"\nAnders fixed his gaze on the man's shiny wing-top shoes.\n\"Not down there. Up there.\" He stuck the pistol under Anders' chin and pushed it upward until Anders was looking at the ceiling.\nAnders had never paid much attention to that part of the bank, a pompous old building with marble floors and counters and pillars, and gilt scrollwork over the tellers' cages. The domed ceiling had been decorated with mythological figures whose fleshy, toga-draped ugliness Anders had taken in at a glance many years earlier and afterward declined to notice. Now he had no choice but to scrutinize the painter's work. It was even worse than he remembered, and all of it executed with the utmost gravity. The artist had a few tricks up his sleeve and used them again and again - a certain rosy blush on the underside of the clouds, a coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns. The ceiling was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders' eye was Zeus and Europa - portrayed, in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow from behind a haystack. To make the cow sexy, the painter had canted her hips suggestively and given her long, droopy eyelashes through which she gazed back at the bull with sultry welcome. The bull wore a smirk and his eyebrows were arched. If there'd been a bubble coming out of his mouth, it would have said, \"Hubba hubba.\"\n\"What's so funny, bright boy?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"You think I'm comical? You think I'm some kind of clown?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"You think you can fuck with me?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Fuck with me again, you're history. Capiche?\"\nAnders burst our laughing. He covered his mouth with both hands and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" then snorted helplessly through his fingers and said, \" Capiche - oh, God, capiche,\" and at that the man with the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right in the head.\nThe bullet smashed Anders' skull and ploughed through his brain and exited behind his right ear, scattering shards of bone into the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum, back toward the basal ganglia, and down into the thalamus. But before all this occurred, the first appearance of the bullet in the cerebrum set off a crackling chain of ion transports and neurotransmissions. Because of their peculiar origin these traced a peculiar patter, flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some forty years past, and long since lost to memory. After striking the cranium the bullet was moving at 900 feet per second, a pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared to the synaptic lighting that flashed around it. Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came under the mediation of brain time, which gave Anders plenty of leisure to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred, \"passed before his eyes.\"\nIt is worth noting what Ambers did not remember, given what he did remember. He did not remember his first lover, Sherry, or what he had most madly loved about her, before it came to irritate him - her unembarrassed carnality, and especially the cordial way she had with his unit, which she called Mr. Mole, as in, \"Uh-oh, looks like Mr. Mole wants to play,\" and \"Let's hide Mr. Mole!\" Anders did not remember his wife, whom he had also loved before she exhausted him with her predictability, or his daughter, now a sullen professor of economics at Dartmouth. He did not remember standing just outside his daughter's door as she lectured her bear about his naughtiness and described the truly appalling punishments Paws would receive unless he changed his ways. He did not remember a single line of the hundreds of poems he had committed to memory in his youth so that he could give himself the shivers at will - not \"Silent, upon a peak in Darien,\" or \"My God, I heard this day,\" or \"All my pretty ones? Did you say all? 0 hell-kite! All?\" None of these did he remember; not one. Anders did not remember his dying mother saying of his father, \"I should have stabbed him in his sleep.\"\nHe did not remember Professor Josephs telling his class how Athenian prisoners in Sicily had been released if they could recite Aeschylus, and then reciting Aeschylus himself, right there, in the Greek. Anders did not remember how his eyes had burned at those sounds. He did not remember the surprise of seeing a college classmate's name on the jacket of a novel not long after they graduated, or the respect he had felt after reading the book. He did not remember the pleasure of giving respect.\nNor did Anders remember seeing a woman leap to her death from the building opposite his own just days after his daughter was born. He did not remember shouting, \"Lord have mercy!\" He did not remember deliberately crashing his father's car in to a tree, of having his ribs kicked in by three policemcn at an anti-war rally, or waking himself up with laughter. He did not remember when he began to regard the heap of books on his desk with boredom and dread, or when he grew angry at writers for writing them. He did not remember when everything began to remind him of something else.\nThis is what he remembered. Heat. A baseball field. Yellow grass, the whirr of insects, himself leaning against a tree as the boys of the neighborhood gather for a pickup game. He looks on as the others argue the relative genius of Mantle and Mays. They have been worrying this subject all summer, and it has become tedious to Anders: an oppresssion, like the heat.\nThen the last two boys arrive, Coyle and a cousin of his from Mississippi. Anders has never met Coyle's cousin before and will never see him again. He says hi with the rest but takes no further notice of him until they've chosen sides and someone asks the cousin what position he wants to play. \"Shortstop,\" the boy says. \"Short's the best position they is.\" Anders turns and looks at him. He wants to hear Coyle's cousin repeat what he's just said, but he knows better than to ask. The others will think he's being a jerk, ragging the kid for his grammar. But that isn't it, not at all - it's that Anders is strangely roused, elated, by those final two words, their pure unexpectedness and their music. He takes the field in a trance, repeating them to himself.\nThe bullet is already in the brain; it won't be outrun forever, or charmed to a halt. In the end it will do its work and leave the troubled skull behind, dragging its comet's tail of memory and hope and talent and love into the marble hall of commerce. That can't be helped. But for now Anders can still make time. Time for the shadows to lengthen on the grass, time for the tethered dog to bark at the flying ball, time for the boy in right field to smack his sweat-blackened mitt and softly chant, They is, they is, they is.\n"

                "content": "\nThe morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers\nwere blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in\nthe square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so\nmany people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th. but in this village,\nwhere there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it\ncould begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home\nfor noon dinner.\nThe children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of\nliberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they\nbroke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and\nreprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon\nfollowed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie\nDelacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name \"Dellacroy\"--eventually made a great pile of stones in\none corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside,\ntalking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in\nthe dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.\nSoon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and\ntaxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and\nthey smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly\nafter their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their\nhusbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children\ncame reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's\ngrasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came\nquickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.\nThe lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr.\nSummers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and\nhe ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him because he had no children and his wife was a\nscold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of\nconversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, \"Little late today, folks.\" The postmaster,\nMr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the\nsquare and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space\nbetween themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, \"Some of you fellows want to give me\na hand?\" there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward\nto hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.\nThe original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the\nstool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr.\nSummers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as\nmuch tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been\nmade with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the\nfirst people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began\ntalking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything\nbeing done. The black box grew shabbier each year: by now it was no longer completely black but\nsplintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.\nMr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had\nstirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or\ndiscarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood\nthat had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well\nwhen the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep\non growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night\nbefore the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box,\nand it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers' coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was\nready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put way, sometimes one\nplace, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves's barn and another year underfoot in\nthe post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.\nThere was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were\nthe lists to make up--of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each\nhousehold in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the\nofficial of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort,\nperformed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly\neach year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or\nsang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this\npart of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of\nthe lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also\nhad changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person\napproaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one\nhand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked\ninterminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.\nJust as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came\nhurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the\nback of the crowd. \"Clean forgot what day it was,\" she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and\nthey both laughed softly. \"Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,\" Mrs. Hutchinson went on.\n\"and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-\nseventh and came a-running.\" She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, \"You're in\ntime, though. They're still talking away up there.\"\nMrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children\nstanding near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her\nway through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through: two or three people\nsaid, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, \"Here comes your, Missus, Hutchinson,\"\nand \"Bill, she made it after all.\" Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had\nbeen waiting, said cheerfully, \"Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.\" Mrs.\nHutchinson said, grinning, \"Wouldn't have me leave m'dishes in the sink, now, would you. Joe?,\" and\nsoft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson's\narrival.\n\"Well, now.\" Mr. Summers said soberly, \"guess we better get started, get this over with, so's we can go\nback to work. Anybody ain't here?\"\n\"Dunbar.\" several people said. \"Dunbar. Dunbar.\"\nMr. Summers consulted his list. \"Clyde Dunbar.\" he said. \"That's right. He's broke his leg, hasn't he?\nWho's drawing for him?\"\n\"Me, I guess,\" a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. \"Wife draws for her husband.\"\nMr. Summers said. \"Don't you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?\" Although Mr. Summers and\neveryone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the\nlottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while\nMrs. Dunbar answered.\n\"Horace's not but sixteen yet.\" Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. \"Guess I gotta fill in for the old man\nthis year.\"\n\"Right,\" Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, \"Watson\nboy drawing this year?\"\nA tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. \"Here,\" he said. \"I m drawing for my mother and me.\" He\nblinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like, \"Good\nfellow, lad,\" and \"Glad to see your mother's got a man to do it.\"\n\"Well,\" Mr. Summers said, \"guess that's everyone. Old Man Warner make it?\"\n\"Here,\" a voice said, and Mr. Summers nodded.\nA sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. \"All ready?\"\nhe called. \"Now, I'll read the names--heads of families first--and the men come up and take a paper out\nof the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn.\nEverything clear?\"\nThe people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions: most of them\nwere quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said,\n\"Adams.\" A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. \"Hi, Steve,\" Mr. Summers said.\nand Mr. Adams said, \"Hi, Joe.\" They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr.\nAdams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he\nturned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not\nlooking down at his hand.\n\"Allen,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Anderson.... Bentham.\"\n\"Seems like there's no time at all between lotteries any more,\" Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in\nthe back row.\n\"Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.\"\n\"Time sure goes fast,\" Mrs. Graves said.\n\"Clark.... Delacroix\"\n\"There goes my old man,\" Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.\n\"Dunbar,\" Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women\nsaid, \"Go on, Janey,\" and another said, \"There she goes.\"\n\"We're next,\" Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box,\ngreeted Mr. Summers gravely and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the\ncrowd, there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hand, turning them over and\nover nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.\n\"Harburt.... Hutchinson.\"\n\"Get up there, Bill,\" Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.\n\"Jones.\"\n\"They do say,\" Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, \"that over in the north\nvillage they're talking of giving up the lottery.\"\nOld Man Warner snorted. \"Pack of crazy fools,\" he said. \"Listening to the young folks, nothing's good\nenough for them. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work\nany more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about 'Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.'\nFirst thing you know, we'd all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There's always been a lottery,\"\nhe added petulantly. \"Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.\"\n\"Some places have already quit lotteries,\" Mrs. Adams said.\n\"Nothing but trouble in that,\" Old Man Warner said stoutly. \"Pack of young fools.\"\n\"Martin.\" And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. \"Overdyke.... Percy.\"\n\"I wish they'd hurry,\" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. \"I wish they'd hurry.\"\n\"They're almost through,\" her son said.\n\"You get ready to run-tell Dad,\" Mrs. Dunbar said.\nMr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box.\nThen he called, \"Warner.\"\n\"Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,\" Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd.\n\"Seventy-seventh time.\"\n\"Watson.\" The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, \"Don't be nervous, Jack,\"\nand Mr. Summers said, \"Take your time, son.\"\n\"Zanini.\"\nAfter that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in\nthe air, said, \"All right, fellows.\" For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were\nopened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, \"Who is it?,\" \"Who's got it?,\" \"Is it\nthe Dunbars?,\" \"Is it the Watsons?\" Then the voices began to say, \"It's Hutchinson. It's Bill,\" \"Bill\nHutchinson's got it.\"\n\"Go tell your father,\" Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.\nPeople began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quietly, staring down\nat the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, \"You didn't give him\ntime enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn't fair!\"\n\"Be a good sport, Tessie,\" Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, \"All of us took the same chance.\"\n\"Shut up, Tessie,\" Bill Hutchinson said.\n\"Well, everyone,\" Mr. Summers said, \"that was done pretty fast, and now we've got to be hurrying a\nlittle more to get done in time.\" He consulted his next list. \"Bill,\" he said, \"you draw for the Hutchinson\nfamily. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?\"\n\"There's Don and Eva,\" Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. \"Make them take their chance!\"\n\"Daughters draw with their husbands' families, Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said gently. \"You know that as well\nas anyone else.\"\n\"It wasn't fair,\" Tessie said.\n\"I guess not, Joe,\" Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. \"My daughter draws with her husband's family;\nthat's only fair. And I've got no other family except the kids.\"\n\"Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it's you,\" Mr. Summers said in explanation, \"and as\nfar as drawing for households is concerned, that's you, too, right?\"\n\"Right,\" Bill Hutchinson said.\n\"How many kids, Bill?\" Mr. Summers asked formally.\n\"Three,\" Bill Hutchinson said.\n\"There's Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.\"\n\"All right, then,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Harry, you got their tickets back?\"\nMr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. \"Put them in the box, then,\" Mr. Summers directed.\n\"Take Bill's and put it in.\"\n\"I think we ought to start over,\" Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. \"I tell you it wasn't fair.\nYou didn't give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.\"\nMr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box. and he dropped all the papers but\nthose onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.\n\"Listen, everybody,\" Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.\n\"Ready, Bill?\" Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife\nand children, nodded.\n\"Remember,\" Mr. Summers said, \"take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken\none. Harry, you help little Dave.\" Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with\nhim up to the box. \"Take a paper out of the box, Davy,\" Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the\nbox and laughed. \"Take just one paper,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Harry, you hold it for him.\" Mr. Graves\ntook the child's hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave\nstood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.\n\"Nancy next,\" Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she\nwent forward switching her skirt and took a slip daintily from the box. \"Bill, Jr.,\" Mr. Summers said, and\nBilly, his face red and his feet overlarge, near knocked the box over as he got a paper out. \"Tessie,\" Mr.\nSummers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up\nto the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.\n\"Bill,\" Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out\nat last with the slip of paper in it.\nThe crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, \"I hope it's not Nancy,\" and the sound of the whisper reached\nthe edges of the crowd.\n\"It's not the way it used to be,\" Old Man Warner said clearly. \"People ain't the way they used to be.\"\n\"All right,\" Mr. Summers said. \"Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave's.\"\nMr. Graves opened the slip of paper, and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up\nand everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time and both\nbeamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.\n\"Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and\nBill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.\n\"It's Tessie,\" Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. \"Show us her paper, Bill.\"\nBill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on\nit, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal company\noffice. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.\n\"All right, folks.\" Mr. Summers said. \"Let's finish quickly.\"\nAlthough the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to\nuse stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground\nwith the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Delacroix selected a stone so large she\nhad to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. \"Come on,\" she said. \"Hurry up.\"\nMr. Dunbar had large stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. \"I can't run at all. You'll\nhave to go ahead, and I'll catch up with you.\"\nThe children had stones already. And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson few pebbles.\nTessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately\nas the villagers moved in on her. \"It isn't fair,\" she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head. Old Man\nWarner was saying, \"Come on, come on, everyone.\" Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of\nvillagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.\n\"It isn't fair, it isn't right,\" Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.\n"

                "content": "\nIt was very late and everyone had left the caf\u00e9 except an old man who sat in\nthe shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light. In the day time\nthe street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked\nto sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the\ndifference. The two waiters inside the caf\u00e9 knew that the old man was a little\ndrunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he\nwould leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.\n\"Last week he tried to commit suicide,\" one waiter said.\n\"Why?\"\n\"He was in despair.\"\n\"What about?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"How do you know it was nothing?\"\n\"He has plenty of money.\"\nThey sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of\nthe caf\u00e9 and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where\nthe old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the\nwind. A girl and a soldier went by in the street. The street light shone on the\nbrass number on his collar. The girl wore no head covering and hurried beside\nhim.\n\"The guard will pick him up,\" one waiter said.\n\"What does it matter if he gets what he's after?\"\n\"He had better get off the street now. The guard will get him. They went by\nfive minutes ago.\"\nThe old man sitting in the shadow rapped on his saucer with his glass. The\nyounger waiter went over to him.\n\"What do you want?\"\nThe old man looked at him. \"Another brandy,\" he said.\n\"You'll be drunk,\" the waiter said. The old man looked at him. The waiter\nwent away.\n\"He'll stay all night,\" he said to his colleague. \"I'm sleepy now. I never get\ninto bed before three o'clock. He should have killed himself last week.\"\nThe waiter took the brandy bottle and another saucer from the counter\ninside the caf\u00e9 and marched out to the old man's table. He put down the saucer\nand poured the glass full of brandy.\n\"You should have killed yourself last week,\" he said to the deaf man. The\nold man motioned with his finger. \"A little more,\" he said. The waiter poured on\ninto the glass so that the brandy slopped over and ran down the stem into the\ntop saucer of the pile. \"Thank you,\" the old man said. The waiter took the bottle\nback inside the caf\u00e9. He sat down at the table with his colleague again.\n\"He's drunk now,\" he said.\n\"He's drunk every night.\"\n\"What did he want to kill himself for?\"\n\"How should I know.\"\n\"How did he do it?\"\n\"He hung himself with a rope.\"\n\"Who cut him down?\"\n\"His niece.\"\n\"Why did they do it?\"\n\"Fear for his soul.\"\n2\n\"How much money has he got?\"\n\"He's got plenty.\"\n\"He must be eighty years old.\"\n\"Anyway I should say he was eighty.\"\n\"I wish he would go home. I never get to bed before three o'clock. What\nkind of hour is that to go to bed?\"\n\"He stays up because he likes it.\"\n\"He's lonely. I'm not lonely. I have a wife waiting in bed for me.\"\n\"He had a wife once too.\"\n\"A wife would be no good to him now.\"\n\"You can't tell. He might be better with a wife.\"\n\"His niece looks after him. You said she cut him down.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"I wouldn't want to be that old. An old man is a nasty thing.\"\n\"Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now,\ndrunk. Look at him.\"\n\"I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for\nthose who must work.\"\nThe old man looked from his glass across the square, then over at the\nwaiters.\n\"Another brandy,\" he said, pointing to his glass. The waiter who was in a\nhurry came over.\n\"Finished,\" he said, speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people\nemploy when talking to drunken people or foreigners. \"No more tonight. Close\nnow.\"\n\"Another,\" said the old man.\n\"No. Finished.\" The waiter wiped the edge of the table with a towel and\nshook his head.\nThe old man stood up, slowly counted the saucers, took a leather coin\npurse from his pocket and paid for the drinks, leaving half a peseta tip.\nThe waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking\nunsteadily but with dignity.\n\"Why didn't you let him stay and drink?\" the unhurried waiter asked. They\nwere putting up the shutters. \"It is not half-past two.\"\n\"I want to go home to bed.\"\n\"What is an hour?\"\n\"More to me than to him.\"\n\"An hour is the same.\"\n\"You talk like an old man yourself. He can buy a bottle and drink at home.\"\n\"It's not the same.\"\n\"No, it is not,\" agreed the waiter with a wife. He did not wish to be unjust.\nHe was only in a hurry.\n\"And you? You have no fear of going home before your usual hour?\"\n\"Are you trying to insult me?\"\n\"No, hombre, only to make a joke.\"\n\"No,\" the waiter who was in a hurry said, rising from pulling down the metal\nshutters. \"I have confidence. I am all confidence.\"\n\"You have youth, confidence, and a job,\" the older waiter said. \"You have\neverything.\"\n\"And what do you lack?\"\n\"Everything but work.\"\n\"You have everything I have.\"\n3\n\"No. I have never had confidence and I am not young.\"\n\"Come on. Stop talking nonsense and lock up.\"\n\"I am of those who like to stay late at the caf\u00e9,\" the older waiter said. \"With\nall those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the\nnight.\"\n\"I want to go home and into bed.\"\n\"We are of two different kinds,\" the older waiter said. He was now dressed\nto go home. \"It is not only a question of youth and confidence although those\nthings are very beautiful. Each night I am reluctant to close up because there\nmay be some one who needs the caf\u00e9.\"\n\"Hombre, there are bodegas open all night long.\"\n\"You do not understand. This is a clean and pleasant caf\u00e9. It is well lighted.\nThe light is very good and also, now, there are shadows of the leaves.\"\n\"Good night,\" said the younger waiter.\n\"Good night,\" the other said. Turning off the electric light he continued the\nconversation with himself. It was the light of course but it is necessary that the\nplace be clean and pleasant. You do not want music. Certainly you do not want\nmusic. Nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is\nprovided for these hours. What did he fear? It was not a fear or dread. It was a\nnothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too.\nIt was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order.\nSome lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues nada y nada y\npues nada. Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy\nwill be nada in nada as it is in nada. Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us\nour nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from\nnada; pues nada. Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. He smiled and\nstood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine.\n\"What's yours?\" asked the barman.\n\"Nada.\"\n\"Otro loco mas,\" said the barman and turned away.\n\"A little cup,\" said the waiter.\nThe barman poured it for him.\n\"The light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished,\" the waiter\nsaid.\nThe barman looked at him but did not answer. It was too late at night for\nconversation.\n\"You want another copita?\" the barman asked.\n\"No, thank you,\" said the waiter and went out. He disliked bars and\nbodegas. A clean, well-lighted caf\u00e9 was a very different thing. Now, without\nthinking further, he would go home to his room. He would lie in the bed and\nfinally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it's\nprobably only insomnia. Many must have it.\n"

                "content": "\n A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man\u2019s hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners\u2014two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as \u201csupport,\u201d that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest\u2014a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.\nBeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of the stream was open ground\u2014a gentle slope topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge. Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators\u2014a single company of infantry in line, at \u201cparade rest,\u201d the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.\nThe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good\u2014a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well fitting frock coat. He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\nThe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his \u201cunsteadfast footing,\u201d then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move! What a sluggish stream!\nHe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift\u2014all had distracted him. And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\u2019s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by\u2014 it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each new stroke with impatience and\u2014he knew not why\u2014apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer; the delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.\nHe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \u201cIf I could free my hands,\u201d he thought, \u201cI might throw off the noose and spring into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader\u2019s farthest advance.\u201d\nAs these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man\u2019s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\nII\nPeyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime. Meanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.\nOne evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.\n\u201cThe Yanks are repairing the railroads,\u201d said the man, \u201cand are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.\u201d\n\u201cHow far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\u201d Farquhar asked.\n\u201cAbout thirty miles.\u201d\n\u201cIs there no force on this side of the creek?\u201d\n\u201cOnly a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.\u201d\n\u201cSuppose a man\u2014a civilian and student of hanging\u2014should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\u201d said Farquhar, smiling, \u201cwhat could he accomplish?\u201d\nThe soldier reflected. \u201cI was there a month ago,\u201d he replied. \u201cI observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tinder.\u201d\nThe lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.\nIII\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened\u2014ages later, it seemed to him\u2014by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness\u2014of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!\u2014the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface\u2014knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. \u201cTo be hanged and drowned,\u201d he thought, \u201cthat is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\u201d\nHe was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!\u2014what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. \u201cPut it back, put it back!\u201d He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!\nHe was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf\u2014he saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\u2019 wings, the strokes of the water spiders\u2019 legs, like oars which had lifted their boat\u2014all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.\nHe had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.\nSuddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.\nA counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\u2019s work. How coldly and pitilessly\u2014with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquility in the men\u2014with what accurately measured interval fell those cruel words:\n\u201cCompany!\u2026 Attention!\u2026 Shoulder arms!\u2026 Ready!\u2026 Aim!\u2026 Fire!\u201d\nFarquhar dived\u2014dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.\nAs he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream\u2014nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.\nThe hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:\n\u201cThe officer,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cwill not make that martinet\u2019s error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!\u201d\nAn appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken an hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.\n\u201cThey will not do that again,\u201d he thought; \u201cthe next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me\u2014the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun.\u201d\nSuddenly he felt himself whirled round and round\u2014spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men, all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color\u2014that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream\u2014the southern bank\u2014and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of AEolian harps. He had not wish to perfect his escape\u2014he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.\nA whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.\nAll that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman\u2019s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\nBy nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which\u2014once, twice, and again\u2014he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.\nHis neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue\u2014he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!\nDoubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene\u2014perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon\u2014then all is darkness and silence!\nPeyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.\n"

                "content": "\n The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled\u2014but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.\nHe had a weak point\u2014this Fortunato\u2014although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity\u2014to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack\u2014but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\nI said to him\u2014\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n\"How?\" said he. \"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\"\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\"I have my doubts.\"\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me\u2014\"\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\"\n\"Come, let us go.\"\n\"Whither?\"\n\"To your vaults.\"\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi\u2014\"\n\"I have no engagement;\u2014come.\"\n\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\"\n\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\"\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.\"\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\n\"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\"\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi\u2014\"\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\"\n\"True\u2014true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily\u2014but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n\"And I to your long life.\"\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n\"I forget your arms.\"\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\n\"And the motto?\"\n\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\"\n\"Good!\" he said.\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\n\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough\u2014\"\n\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\"\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement\u2014a grotesque one.\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\n\"You? Impossible! A mason?\"\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\n\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire.\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\"\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi\u2014\"\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated\u2014I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re-echoed\u2014I aided\u2014I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said\u2014\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\u2014he! he! he!\u2014a very good joke indeed\u2014an excellent jest. We shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo\u2014he! he! he!\u2014over our wine\u2014he! he! he!\"\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n\"He! he! he!\u2014he! he! he!\u2014yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n\"For the love of God, Montresor!\"\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud\u2014\n\"Fortunato!\"\nNo answer. I called again\u2014\n\"Fortunato\u2014\"\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat! \n"

                "content": "\nAlexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.\nMultivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.\nFor decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.\nBut slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.\nThe energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.\nSeven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.\nThey had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.\n\"It's amazing when you think of it,\" said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. \"All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.\"\nLupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. \"Not forever,\" he said.\n\"Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.\"\n\"That's not forever.\"\n\"All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Ten billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?\"\nLupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. \"Ten billion years isn't forever.\"\n\"Well, it will last our time, won't it?\"\n\"So would the coal and uranium.\"\n\"All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can't do that on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe me.\n\"I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that.\"\n\"Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us,\" said Adell, blazing up, \"It did all right.\"\n\"Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying. We're safe for ten billion years, but then what?\" Lupow pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. \"And don't say we'll switch to another sun.\"\nThere was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested.\nThen Lupov's eyes snapped open. \"You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren't you?\"\n\"I'm not thinking.\"\n\"Sure you are. You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.\"\n\"I get it,\" said Adell. \"Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too.\"\n\"Darn right they will,\" muttered Lupov. \"It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last ten billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all.\"\n\"I know all about entropy,\" said Adell, standing on his dignity.\n\"The hell you do.\"\n\"I know as much as you do.\"\n\"Then you know everything's got to run down someday.\"\n\"All right. Who says they won't?\"\n\"You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said 'forever.'\nIt was Adell's turn to be contrary. \"Maybe we can build things up again someday,\" he said.\n\"Never.\"\n\"Why not? Someday.\"\n\"Never.\"\n\"Ask Multivac.\"\n\"You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done.\"\nAdell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?\nOr maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?\nMultivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.\nThen, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\n\"No bet,\" whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.\nBy next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten the incident.\nJerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright shining disk, the size of a marble, centered on the viewing-screen.\n\"That's X-23,\" said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.\nThe little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of insideoutness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, \"We've reached X-23 -- we've reached X-23 -- we've --\"\n\"Quiet, children.\" said Jerrodine sharply. \"Are you sure, Jerrodd?\"\n\"What is there to be but sure?\" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.\nJerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps.\nJerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship. Someone had once told Jerrodd that the \"ac\" at the end of \"Microvac\" stood for ''automatic computer\" in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.\nJerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. \"I can't help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.\"\n\"Why, for Pete's sake?\" demanded Jerrodd. \"We had nothing there. We'll have everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great-grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.\" Then, after a reflective pause, \"I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.\"\n\"I know, I know,\" said Jerrodine miserably.\nJerrodette I said promptly, \"Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.\"\n\"I think so, too,\" said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.\nIt was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors, had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.\nJerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetarv AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.\n\"So many stars, so many planets,\" sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. \"I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.\"\n\"Not forever,\" said Jerrodd, with a smile. \"It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.\n\"What's entropy, daddy?\" shrilled Jerrodette II.\n\"Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?\"\n\"Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?\"\n\"The stars are the power-units. dear. Once they're gone, there are no more power-units.\"\nJerrodette I at once set up a howl. \"Don't let them, daddy. Don't let the stars run down.\"\n\"Now look what you've done,\" whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.\n\"How was I to know it would frighten them?\" Jerrodd whispered back,\n\"Ask the Microvac,\" wailed Jerrodette I. \"Ask him how to turn the stars on again.\"\n\"Go ahead,\" said Jerrodine. \"It will quiet them down.\" (Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)\nJerrodd shrugged. \"Now, now, honeys. I'll ask Microvac. Don't worry, he'll tell us.\"\nHe asked the Microvac, adding quickly, \"Print the answer.\"\nJerrodd cupped the strip or thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, \"See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry.\"\nJerrodine said, \"And now, children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon.\"\nJerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\nHe shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.\nVJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, \"Are we ridiculous, I wonder in being so concerned about the matter?\"\nMQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. \"I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.\"\nBoth seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.\n\"Still,\" said VJ-23X, \"I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.\"\n\"I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up.\"\nVJ-23X sighed. \"Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.\"\n\"A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years --\nVJ-23X interrupted. \"We can thank immortality for that.\"\n\"Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.\"\n\"Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose.\"\n\"Not at all,\" snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, \"Not yet. I'm by no means old enough. How old are you?\"\n\"Two hundred twenty-three. And you?\"\n\"I'm still under two hundred. --But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this GaIaxy is filled, we'll have filled another in ten years. Another ten years and we'll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we'll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known universe. Then what?\"\nVJ-23X said, \"As a side issue, there's a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.\"\n\"A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.\"\n\"Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.\"\n\"Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population. We'll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.\"\n\"We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.\"\n\"Or out of dissipated heat?\" asked MQ-17J, sarcastically.\n\"There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC.\"\nVJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.\n\"I've half a mind to,\" he said. \"It's something the human race will have to face someday.\"\nHe stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC.\nMQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of submesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite its sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across.\nMQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, \"Can entropy ever be reversed?\"\nVJ-23X looked startled and said at once, \"Oh, say, I didn't really mean to have you ask that.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"We both know entropy can't be reversed. You can't turn smoke and ash back into a tree.\"\n\"Do you have trees on your world?\" asked MQ-17J.\nThe sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\nVJ-23X said, \"See!\"\nThe two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.\nZee Prime's mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity. --But a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space.\nMinds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.\nZee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.\n\"I am Zee Prime,\" said Zee Prime. \"And you?\"\n\"I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?\"\n\"We call it only the Galaxy. And you?\"\n\"We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?\"\n\"True. Since all Galaxies are the same.\"\n\"Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.\"\nZee Prime said, \"On which one?\"\n\"I cannot say. The Universal AC would know.\"\n\"Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.\"\nZee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrank and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.\nZee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and he called out: \"Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?\"\nThe Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor led through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.\nZee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.\n\"But how can that be all of Universal AC?\" Zee Prime had asked.\n\"Most of it,\" had been the answer, \"is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.\"\nNor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a Universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.\nThe Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.\nA thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. \"THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN.\"\nBut it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Lee Prime stifled his disappointment.\nDee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, \"And is one of these stars the original star of Man?\"\nThe Universal AC said, \"MAN'S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS A WHITE DWARF\"\n\"Did the men upon it die?\" asked Lee Prime, startled and without thinking.\nThe Universal AC said, \"A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TlME.\"\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.\nDee Sub Wun said, \"What is wrong?\"\n\"The stars are dying. The original star is dead.\"\n\"They must all die. Why not?\"\n\"But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them.\"\n\"It will take billions of years.\"\n\"I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?\"\nDee Sub Wun said in amusement, \"You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.\"\nAnd the Universal AC answered: \"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\"\nZee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a Galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter.\nUnhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.\nMan considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.\nMan said, \"The Universe is dying.\"\nMan looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.\nNew stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.\nMan said, \"Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.\"\n\"But even so,\" said Man, \"eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase forever to the maximum.\"\nMan said, \"Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.\"\nThe Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that Man could comprehend.\n\"Cosmic AC,\" said Man, \"how may entropy be reversed?\"\nThe Cosmic AC said, \"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\"\nMan said, \"Collect additional data.\"\nThe Cosmic AC said, 'I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT.\n\"Will there come a time,\" said Man, \"when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?\"\nThe Cosmic AC said, \"NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.\"\nMan said, \"When will you have enough data to answer the question?\"\nThe Cosmic AC said, \"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\"\n\"Will you keep working on it?\" asked Man.\nThe Cosmic AC said, \"I WILL.\"\nMan said, \"We shall wait.\"\nThe stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down.\nOne by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.\nMan's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.\nMan said, \"AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?\"\nAC said, \"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\"\nMan's last mind fused and only AC existed -- and that in hyperspace.\nMatter and energy had ended and with it space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer [technician] ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.\nAll other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.\nAll collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.\nBut all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.\nA timeless interval was spent in doing that.\nAnd it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.\nBut there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.\nFor another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.\nThe consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.\nAnd AC said, \"LET THERE BE LIGHT!\"\nAnd there was light --\n"

                "content": "\nIt all began when the new bookkeeping machine of a large Midwestern coffin manufacturer slipped a cog, or blew a transistor, or something. It was fantastic that the error\u2014one of two decimal places\u2014should enjoy a straight run of okays, human and mechanical, clear down the line; but when the figures clacked out at the last clacking-out station, there it was. The figures were now sacred; immutable; and it is doubtful whether the President of the concern or the Chairman of the Board would have dared question them\u2014even if either of those two gentlemen had been in town.\nAs for the Advertising Manager, the last thing he wanted to do was question them. He carried them (they were the budget for the coming fiscal year) into his office, staggering a little on the way, and dropped dazedly into his chair. They showed the budget for his own department as exactly one hundred times what he'd been expecting. That is to say, fifty times what he'd put in for.\nWhen the initial shock began to wear off, his face assumed an expression of intense thought. In about five minutes he leaped from his chair, dashed out of the office with a shouted syllable or two for his secretary, and got his car out of the parking lot. At home, he tossed clothes into a travelling bag and barged toward the door, giving his wife a quick kiss and an equally quick explanation. He didn't bother to call the airport. He meant to be on the next plane east, and no nonsense about it....\n\nWith one thing and another, the economy hadn't been exactly in overdrive that year, and predictions for the Christmas season were gloomy. Early [127]retail figures bore them out. Gift buying dribbled along feebly until Thanksgiving, despite brave speeches by the Administration. The holiday passed more in self-pity than in thankfulness among owners of gift-oriented businesses.\nThen, on Friday following Thanksgiving, the coffin ads struck.\nStruck may be too mild a word. People on the streets saw feverishly-working crews (at holiday rates!) slapping up posters on billboards. The first poster was a dilly. A toothy and toothsome young woman leaned over a coffin she'd been unwrapping. She smiled as if she'd just received overtures of matrimony from an eighty-year-old billionaire. There was a Christmas tree in the background, and the coffin was appropriately wrapped. So was she. She looked as if she had just gotten out of bed, or were ready to get into it. For amorous young men, and some not so young, the message was plain. The motto, \"The Gift That Will Last More Than a Lifetime\", seemed hardly to the point.\nThose at home were assailed on TV with a variety of bright and clever skits of the same import. Some of them hinted that, if the young lady's gratitude were really precipitous, and the bedroom too far away, the coffin might be comfy.\nOf course the more settled elements of the population were not neglected. For the older married man, there was a blow directly between the eyes: \"Do You Want Your Widow to Be Half-Safe?\" And, for the spinster without immediate hopes, \"I Dreamt I Was Caught Dead Without My Virginform Casket!\"\nNewspapers, magazines and every other medium added to the assault, never letting it cool. It was the most horrendous campaign, for sheer concentration, that had ever battered at the public mind. The public reeled, blinked, shook its head to clear it, gawked, and rushed out to buy.\n[128]Christmas was not going to be a failure after all. Department store managers who had, grudgingly and under strong sales pressure, made space for a single coffin somewhere at the rear of the store, now rushed to the telephones like touts with a direct pronouncement from a horse. Everyone who possibly could got into the act. Grocery supermarkets put in casket departments. The Association of Pharmaceutical Retailers, who felt they had some claim to priority, tried to get court injunctions to keep caskets out of service stations, but were unsuccessful because the judges were all out buying caskets. Beauty parlors showed real ingenuity in merchandising. Roads and streets clogged with delivery trucks, rented trailers, and whatever else could haul a coffin. The Stock Market went completely mad. Strikes were declared and settled within hours. Congress was called into session early. The President got authority to ration lumber and other materials suddenly in starvation-short supply. State laws were passed against cremation, under heavy lobby pressure. A new racket, called boxjacking, blossomed overnight.\nThe Advertising Manager who had put the thing over had been fighting with all the formidable weapons of his breed to make his plant managers build up a stockpile. They had, but it went like a toupee in a wind tunnel. Competitive coffin manufacturers were caught napping, but by Wednesday after Thanksgiving they, along with the original one, were on a twenty-four hour, seven-day basis. Still only a fraction of the demand could be met. Jet passenger planes were stripped of their seats, supplied with Yankee gold, and sent to plunder the world of its coffins.\nIt might be supposed that Christmas goods other than caskets would take a bad dumping. That was not so. Such was the upsurge of prosperity, and such was the shortage of coffins, that nearly everything\u2014with a few exceptions\u2014enjoyed the biggest season on record.\nOn Christmas Eve the frenzy slumped to a crawl, though on Christmas morning there were still optimists out prowling the empty stores. The nation sat down to breathe. Mostly it sat on coffins, because there wasn't space in the living rooms for any other furniture.\nThere was hardly an individual in the United States who didn't have, in case of sudden sharp pains in the chest, several boxes to choose from. As for the rest of the world, it had better not die just now or it would be literally a case of dust to dust.\n[129] Coffin Advertisement\n\n[130]Of course everyone expected a doozy of a slump after Christmas. But our Advertising Manager, who by now was of course Sales Manager and First Vice President also, wasn't settling for any boom-and-bust. He'd been a frustrated victim of his choice of industries for so many years that now, with his teeth in something, he was going to give it the old bite. He gave people a short breathing spell to arrange their coffin payments and move the presents out of the front rooms. Then, late in January, his new campaign came down like a hundred-megatonner.\nWithin a week, everyone saw quite clearly that his Christmas models were now obsolete. The coffin became the new status symbol.\nThe auto industry was of course demolished. Even people who had enough money to buy a new car weren't going to trade in the old one and let the new one stand out in the rain. The garages were full of coffins. Petroleum went along with Autos. (Though there were those who whispered knowingly that the same people merely moved over into the new industry. It was noticeable that the center of it became Detroit.) A few trucks and buses were still being built, but that was all.\nSome of the new caskets were true works of art. Others\u2014well, there was variety. Compact models appeared, in which the occupant's feet were to be doubled up alongside his ears. One manufacturer pushed a circular model, claiming that by all the laws of nature the foetal position was the only right one. At the other extreme were virtual houses, ornate and lavishly equipped. Possibly the largest of all was the \"Togetherness\" model, triangular, with graduated recesses for Father, Mother, eight children (plus two playmates), and, in the far corner beyond the baby, the cat.\nThe slump was over. Still, economists swore that the new boom couldn't last either. They reckoned without the Advertising Manager, whose eyes gleamed brighter all the time. People already had coffins, which they polished and kept on display, sometimes in the new \"Coffin-ports\" being added to houses. The Advertising Manager's reasoning was direct and to the point. He must get people to use the coffins; and now he had all the money to work with that he could use.\nThe new note was woven in so gradually that it is not easy to put a finger on any one ad and [131]say, \"It began here.\" One of the first was surely the widely-printed one showing a tattooed, smiling young man with his chin thrust out manfully, lying in a coffin. He was rugged-looking and likable (not too rugged for the spindly-limbed to identify with) and he oozed, even though obviously dead, virility at every pore. He was probably the finest-looking corpse since Richard the Lion-Hearted.\nNeither must one overlook the singing commercials. Possibly the catchiest of these, a really cute little thing, was achieved by jazzing up the Funeral March.\nIt started gradually, and it was all so un-violent that few saw it as suicide. Teen-agers began having \"Popping-off parties\". Some of their elders protested a little, but adults were taking it up too. The tired, the unappreciated, the ill and the heavy-laden lay down in growing numbers and expired. A black market in poisons operated for a little while, but soon pinched out. Such was the pressure of persuasion that few needed artificial aids. The boxes were very comfortable. People just closed their eyes and exited smiling.\nThe Beatniks, who had their own models of coffin\u2014mouldy, scroungy, and without lids, since the Beatniks insisted on being seen\u2014placed their boxes on the Grant Avenue in San Francisco. They died with highly intellectual expressions, and eventually were washed by the gentle rain.\nOf course there were voices shouting calamity. When aren't there? But in the long run, and not a very long one at that, they availed naught.\n\nIt isn't hard to imagine the reactions of the rest of the world. So let us imagine a few.\nThe Communist Block immediately gave its Stamp of Disapproval, denouncing the movement as a filthy Capitalist Imperialist Pig plot. Red China, which had been squabbling with Russia for some time about a matter of method, screamed for immediate war. Russia exposed this as patent stupidity, saying that if the Capitalists wanted to die, warring upon them would only help them. China surreptitiously tried out the thing as an answer to excess population, and found it good. It also appealed to the well-known melancholy facet of Russian nature. Besides, after pondering for several days, the Red Bloc decided it could not afford to fall behind in anything, so it started its own program, explaining with much logic how it differed.\nAn elderly British philosopher endorsed the movement, on the grounds that a temporary [132]setback in Evolution was preferable to facing up to anything.\nThe Free Bloc, the Red Bloc, the Neutral Bloc and such scraps as had been too obtuse to find themselves a Bloc were drawn into the whirlpool in an amazingly short time, if in a variety of ways. In less than two years the world was rid of most of what had been bedeviling it.\nOddly enough, the country where the movement began was the last to succumb completely. Or perhaps it is not so odd. Coffin-maker to the world, the American casket industry had by now almost completely automated box-making and gravedigging, with some interesting assembly lines and packaging arrangements; there still remained the jobs of management and distribution. The President of General Mortuary, an ebullient fellow affectionately called Sarcophagus Sam, put it well. \"As long as I have a single prospective customer, and a single Stockholder,\" he said, mangling a stogie and beetling his brows at the one reporter who'd showed up for the press conference, \"I'll try to put him in a coffin so I can pay him a dividend.\"\n\nFinally, though, a man who thought he must be the last living human, wandered contentedly about the city of Denver looking for the coffin he liked best. He settled at last upon a rich mahogany number with platinum trimmings, an Automatic Self-Adjusting Cadaver-contour Innerspring Wearever-Plastic-Covered Mattress with a built in bar. He climbed in, drew himself a generous slug of fine Scotch, giggled as the mattress prodded him exploringly, closed his eyes and sighed in solid comfort. Soft music played as the lid closed itself.\nFrom a building nearby a turkey-buzzard swooped down, cawing in raucous anger because it had let its attention wander for a moment. It was too late. It clawed screaming at the solid cover, hissed in frustration and finally gave up. It flapped into the air again, still grumbling. It was tired of living on dead small rodents and coyotes. It thought it would take a swing over to Los Angeles, where the pickings were pretty good.\nAs it moved westward over parched hills, it espied two black dots a few miles to its left. It circled over for a closer look, then grunted and went on its way. It had seen them before. The old prospector and his burro had been in the mountains for so long the buzzard had concluded they didn't know how to die.\nThe prospector, whose name [133]was Adams, trudged behind his burro toward the buildings that shimmered in the heat, humming to himself now and then or addressing some remark to the beast. When he reached the outskirts of Denver he realized something was amiss. He stood and gazed at the quiet scene. Nothing moved except some skinny packrats and a few sparrows foraging for grain among the unburied coffins.\n\"Tarnation!\" he said to the burro. \"Martians?\"\nA half-buried piece of newspaper fluttered in the breeze. He walked forward slowly and picked it up. It told him enough so that he understood.\n\"They're gone, Evie,\" he said to the burro, \"all gone.\" He put his arm affectionately around her neck. \"I reckon it's up to me and you agin. We got to start all over.\" He stood back and gazed at her with mild reproach. \"I shore hope they don't favor your side of the house so much this time.\"\u2014C.C. MacAPP\n"

                "content": "\nHansen was sitting at the control board in the single building on Communications Relay Station 43.4SC, when the emergency light flashed on for the first time in two hundred years.\nWith textbook-recommended swiftness, he located the position of the ship sending the call, identified the ship and the name of its captain, and made contact.\n\u201cThis is Hansen on 43.4SC. Put me through to Captain Fromer.\u201d\n\u201cFromer here,\u201d said an incredible deep voice, \u201cwhat the devil do you want?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d asked the astonished Hansen. \u201cIt was you, sir, who sent the emergency call.\u201d\n\u201cI did no such thing,\u201d said Fromer with great certainty.\n\u201cBut the light flashed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been out of school?\u201d Fromer asked.\n\u201cAlmost a year, sir, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat you\u2019re imagining things and that you\u2019ve been sitting on that asteroid hoping that something would happen to break the monotony. Now leave me the hell alone or I\u2019ll put you on report.\u201d\n\u201cNow look here,\u201d Hansen began, practically beside himself with frustration, \u201cI saw that emergency light go on. Maybe it was activated automatically when something went out of order on your ship.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t allow emergencies on the Euclid Queen,\u201d said Fromer with growing anger. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nHansen spared himself the indignity of being cut off. He broke contact himself. He sighed, reached for a book entitled Emergency Procedure Rules, and settled back in his chair.\nFifteen minutes later the emergency light flashed on for the second time in two hundred years. With its red glow illuminating his freckled excited face, Hansen triumphantly placed another call to the Euclid Queen.\n\u201cThis is Hansen on 43.4SC. Let me speak to Captain Fromer, please.\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2014the Captain has asked me to contact you. I\u2019m the navigator. I was just about to call you. We have a small problem that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll speak to the Captain,\u201d Hansen repeated grimly.\n\u201cNow see here. I\u2019m perfectly capable of handling this situation. Actually, it\u2019s hardly even an emergency. You were, it seems, signaled automatically when\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll check your emergency procedures,\u201d Hansen said, holding his thumb in the Rule Book, \u201cyou\u2019ll note that the Relay Station Attendant contacts the Captain personally during all emergencies. Of course, if you want to violate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLook, old man,\u201d said the navigator, now sounding on the verge of tears, \u201ctry to realize the spot I\u2019m in. Fromer has ordered me to handle this thing without his assistance. He seems to feel that you have a grudge of some kind\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t put me in touch with Captain Fromer in five minutes, I\u2019ll put through a call to Sector Headquarters.\u201d Hansen signaled off contact. If he knew nothing else about the situation, he knew that he had the upper hand.\nFive minutes later Captain Fromer called him back. \u201cI am calling in accordance with emergency procedures,\u201d Fromer said between clinched teeth. \u201cThe situation is this: We are reporting an emergency\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat class emergency?\u201d Hansen interrupted.\n\u201cClass?\u201d asked Fromer, obviously caught off guard.\n\u201cYes, Captain. There are three classes of emergencies. Major class, which would include death and injury. Mechanical class, including malfunction of Hegler units and such. And General class\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, of course, General class by all means,\u201d Fromer said hurriedly. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s hardly even an emergency. We\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust what is the nature of the trouble, Captain?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, uh, well it seems that we were doing a preliminary landing procedure check, and . . .\u201d\n\u201cYes, go on.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, er, it seems that we can\u2019t get the door open.\u201d\nIt was Hansen\u2019s turn to be taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019re pulling my leg, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI most certainly am not,\u201d Captain Fromer said emphatically.\n\u201cYou really mean that you can\u2019t open the door?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Something\u2019s wrong with the mechanism. Our technical staff has never encountered a problem like this, and they advise me that any attempt at repair might possibly result in the opposite situation.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean not being able to get the door closed?\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely. In other words, we can\u2019t land.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Then I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing I can do except advise Sector Headquarters to send an emergency repair crew.\u201d\nCaptain Fromer sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, too. How long will it take for a message to get there with your transmitting equipment?\u201d\n\u201cTwo days, Captain. At a guess, there\u2019ll be a ship alongside within the week. You\u2019ll be maintaining your present position, I assume?\u201d\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ll be here, all right,\u201d Fromer said bitterly. Then he cut contact.\nAs the single occupant of a large asteroid with nothing but time and boredom on his hands, Hansen was enjoying the whole situation immensely. He allowed himself the luxury of several dozen fantasies in which his name was mentioned prominently in galaxy-wide reports of the episode. He imagined that Captain Fromer was also creating vivid accounts\u2014of quite another sort\u2014that would soon be amusing several hundred billion news-hungry citizens of the Federation.\nWhen the repair ship arrived, it came, to Hansen\u2019s astonishment, to the asteroid, and not alongside Fromer\u2019s ship. He soon found out that there was someone else who shared the Captain\u2019s embarrassment.\n\u201cI\u2019m Bullard,\u201d said a tall, thin, mournful man. \u201cMind if I sit?\u201d\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Hansen waved a hand toward the meager accommodations. He had no idea why a Senior Engineer was being so deferential, but he enjoyed the feeling of power.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering about a lot of things,\u201d Bullard began sadly. \u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t have any ideas about how we can fix Captain Fromer\u2019s door.\u201d He waited to let that sink in. Then he continued: \u201cIt took us three days back at the base to find out that when these ships were built, almost five hundred years ago, nobody bothered to include detail drawings of the door mechanism.\u201d\n\u201cBut why? You certainly know how to build\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe know how to build Star Class ships, sure. We\u2019ve built a few in the past century or two. There\u2019s never been need for replacement, really. These ships are designed to last forever. The original fleet was conceived to fill the System\u2019s needs for a full thousand years.\u201d\n\u201cBut the doors on the few ships that have been built. How\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe ship\u2019s we\u2019ve built were exact duplicates of Captain Fromer\u2019s ship\u2014except for the door.\u201d Bullard\u2019s long face radiated despair. \u201cNo one ever questioned why the door mechanism wasn\u2019t included in the original plans. We simply designed another type\u2014a different type\u2014of door.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you certainly can find out how this particular door works, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d Bullard said, wringing his hands. \u201cBut we have a couple of other problems. Number one, Captain Fromer has an extremely important passenger aboard. None other than His Exalted Excellency, R\u2019thagna Bar. He is\u2014or was\u2014on his way home after concluding a treaty of friendship with the President of the Federation.\u201d\nHansen managed a whistle.\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Bullard continued, \u201cHis Excellency has to be home soon to get there in time for the mating season. This occurs once in a lifetime, I\u2019m told, and this is his only chance to continue the ancestral rule\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAre you trying to say that you can\u2019t solve a simple problem like getting him home and getting him out of the ship? You can always cut it in two, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThese ships were made to last forever,\u201d Bullard explained. \u201cThe hull is, of course, pseudo-met, but, not the kind of pseudo-met used for other applications. In short, about the only way you\u2019ll get in that ship is to vaporize it.\u201d\n\u201cBut can\u2019t you simply disassemble the door mechanism? My God, how complicated can it be?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to do just that,\u201d Bullard said without a trace of confidence. \u201cAs far as the complication goes, let me say just this: it\u2019s full of moving parts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d Hansen asked.\n\u201cJust this. These ships are perfect mechanisms. There is hardly anything in them that could be called a moving part. Now a door has to open and close. Sure, we devised a simple, safe way to do it a few hundred years after the original fleet was built. The men who designed the original door mechanism felt, perhaps, that it was incongruous to include it in the first place. Maybe that is why they threw away the plans. God knows, it is incongruous. Look! Here\u2019s a photo we took of one in a ship back at base.\u201d\nHansen scanned the photograph. It was a meaningless jumble. He handed it back. \u201cWell, make yourself at home. I\u2019m afraid that the only thing I can help with will be radio communication to Captain Fromer\u2019s ship.\u201d\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting someone else tomorrow. After you bring him down, feel free to drop over and see me anytime.\u201d\nBullard went back to his ship, and Hansen went to bed. He dreamed of His Exalted Excellency R\u2019thagna Bar, growing angrier day by day as the time of mating came closer. In his dream he suddenly came upon a magnificent solution to the problem, a solution involving a telepathic system of fertilization. He woke up before he had completely worked out the details.\nBullard\u2019s friend arrived the same morning. He was a small, dark active little man whom Hansen immediately disliked.\n\u201cMeet Dr. Quemos,\u201d Bullard said when Hansen dropped in on them. \u201cDr. Quemos is a specialist in the history of technology. He thinks he knows how our cute little door mechanism is made.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say for sure,\u201d Quemos said, \u201cbut I\u2019d guess that those components are made of metal\u2014real metal.\u201d\n\u201cI thought that metal was used only in jewelry,\u201d Hansen said.\nDr. Quemos grinned slyly. \u201cThat\u2019s what most people think. Actually, refined metal of various types was used in large masses, formed masses, for thousands of years. Historically speaking, the pseudo-mets are relatively new.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine metal functioning as machinery,\u201d Hansen mused.\n\u201cAnd you say that this door mechanism has moving parts, lots of them?\u201d\n\u201cMoving parts are nothing to be afraid of,\u201d Quemos said. \u201cHere, look at this.\u201d He put something small on the table, much in the manner of a young boy dropping a garter snake in the midst of school girls. Bullard and Hansen crowded around. \u201cNow, take turns,\u201d said Quemos sharply, \u201cand don\u2019t drop it. It\u2019s priceless, I assure you.\u201d The ancient wrist watch with its transparent back was passed from hand to hand.\n\u201cFrightening little monster, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Bullard said.\n\u201cThose small round wheels are called gears,\u201d elucidated Quemos, \u201cone gear turns another, which turns another, and so on. I rather imagine that your door is operated on some similar principle.\u201d\n\u201cI seem to be the one who asks all the schoolboy questions,\u201d Hansen began, \u201cwould somebody tell me why Captain Fromer doesn\u2019t take His Excellency to his home planet, land the ship, and then let his technical staff tear off the door mechanism?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through that,\u201d Bullard said wearily. \u201cUnfortunately we need special tools. And there\u2019s no way to get them into the ship.\u201d\n\u201cCan I speak to Captain Fromer?\u201d Quemos asked.\n\u201cRight away,\u201d Hansen said. He pressed his hand in various patterns on his belt. \u201cThis is Hansen. Let us talk to Captain Fromer, please.\u201d\n\u201cFromer here. Who is it?\u201d\n\u201cDr. Quemos speaking. How is your passenger?\u201d\n\u201cMy passenger is fine. But he keeps telling me that he is very anxious to plant his seed. When can you get us out of here?\u201d\n\u201cPlant his seed?\u201d said Quemos.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing salacious about this, I\u2019ve been assured. He simply has a biological craving at this time in his life to\u2014to plant his seed.\u201d\n\u201cI got problems like that, too,\u201d Bullard said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t go around telling everybody.\u201d\n\u201cStop clowning,\u201d Fromer snapped, \u201cyou guys better find a way to fix this damn door or you\u2019ll have a galactic war on your hands. Anybody have any ideas yet?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure that the door mechanism is made of metal,\u201d Quemos said, \u201cand the construction is probably based on the principal of a worm gear.\u201d\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\u201cA worm gear, Captain,\u201d Quemos said patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient metal device that was sometimes used for closing large doors. There is also the possibility that the door is closed and opened by dogs. These seem to have been used, at least, to operate doors of undersea crafts. Although we\u2019re not quite certain about the function of dogs.\u201d\nThe captain maintained a stony silence.\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Quemos continued, \u201cwe have unearthed, so to speak, a reference to a metal component called a babbitt\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow see here!\u201d Captain Fromer roared, \u201cwho do you think you\u2019re kidding with this talk about worms, dogs and rabbits\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBabbitts, Captain, babbitts! Perhaps a type of bearing. Anyway, we\u2019re at work on the problem, I assure you.\u201d Quemos motioned to Hansen that he was through talking.\nDuring the next three days, Hansen twice visited Bullard and Quemos. On each occasion, he found the two men in trance-like conditions, ostensibly thinking through the problem that they had been assigned to solve, but more probably, Hansen guessed, brooding about the reaction of Sector Headquarters to their daily progress reports which Hansen had been relaying for them. Hansen had only sympathy for the people back at Sector Headquarters, for if these two experts were the Galaxy\u2019s two top trouble-shooters, the Federation, was not, as Hansen put it to himself, in very good shape to fight a war with one hundred billion enraged citizens who worshiped His Exalted Excellency R\u2019thagna Bar almost as much as they did his seed.\nHansen went back to his reading, only to be interrupted with increasing frequency by message transmissions from an increasingly alarmed Sector Headquarters. Most messages were addressed to Bullard, and were bravely designed to disguise the senders\u2019 hysteria, while at the same time urging Bullard on to more magnificent efforts. A few messages, fairly representative of the state of affairs as time wore on reflected an increasing suspicion on the part of Sector Headquarters that Quemos and Bullard, although certainly tops in their fields, were not tops enough.\nsec hdq\nbullard, com. rly.\n43.4sc\npresident would like estimate of when door will be opened. you sure you can handle? emphasize that political situation now getting touchy. repeat touchy. r\u2019thagna bar calling on president today to make demand that seed be planted on time. sure you don\u2019t need more help?\ncmd general\ncmd general\nno help needed. making progress, assure president. today found out metal in mechanism is very hard. in constant radio touch with fromer. passenger impatient but quieter. sleeps more now. this significant? quemos developing theory of mechanism. says will take time to work out. how much time we have? when must seed be planted?\nbullard\nsec hdq\nbullard, com. rly.\n43.4sc\nmust have estimate when door opens. this an order. ambassador threatening war. can\u2019t give deadline of seed planting time since subject very taboo. our biologists say r\u2019thagna bar sleepy significant. may be prelude to seeding time. tell about quemos theory in next communication. will evaluate here. nice to know metal is hard. keep up good work. pressure here to send you help. president says whole federation praying for door to be fixed. says to hurry up.\ncmd general\ncmd general\nno estimate possible. quemos theory almost complete. states that mechanism built on principle of worm gear. repeat. worm gear. today instructed fromer\u2019s crew to jiggle moving parts of mechanism at random. parts would not jiggle. fromer states that r\u2019thagna bar sleeps all time and color changes to blue and red on stomach. this significant?\nbullard\nsec hdq\nbullard, com. rly.\n43.4sc\nimportant you amplify last message. red and blue on stomach? why r\u2019thagna bar undressed? investigate! president orders help sent. help on way. repeat. why r\u2019thagna bar undressed?\ncmd general\ncmd general\nfromer advises tell you ships physician has put r\u2019thagna bar in refrigerator.\nquemos\nsec hdq\nbullard, com. rly.\n43.4sc\ntake out of refrigerator! this an order! why undressed?\ncmd general\ncmd general\nbullard making model of my drawings. ready soon. r\u2019thagna bar out of refrigerator as requested but ships physician very angry and wants to put back in. color on stomach pink and yellow with blue squares. this significant?\nquemos\nIt went on like this for several more days. Hansen, at first amused, was now alarmed and completely convinced that both Quemos and Bullard were thoroughly useless. The messages were his only source of information, since both \u201cexperts\u201d were too immersed in their work to talk with him. As his alarm grew, he decided that he might at least try to strike up a friendship with someone on board Captain Fromer\u2019s sealed ship\u2014someone who might have something comforting to report. He called up the ship\u2019s navigator.\n\u201cThis is Hansen. How\u2019re things going up there?\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean? Good or bad?\u201d\n\u201cIt means,\u201d the navigator said, while yawning, \u201cthat things are falling apart rapidly. In fact, in a day or two I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make much difference whether or not they open that damn door.\u201d\n\u201cYou, er, care to fill me in?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the navigator, with the voice of a man who knows that it is too late for anything to matter. \u201cThe members of the crew are divided into two factions. It appears that our physician has rallied half the crew to support his medical contention that our exhalted passenger belongs in the refrigerator. The good captain, with some justice, one must admit, thinks that he is in command of the ship, and prefers to believe that R\u2019thagna Bar belongs out of the refrigerator.\u201d\n\u201cWho seems to be winning the argument?\u201d\n\u201cArgument? There\u2019s no argument, old man\u2014it\u2019s open warfare. No weapons aboard, of course, but the two teams are grappling up and down the corridors and shuttling our exhalted passenger in and out of the ice box about four times each hour. Quite a sight, really. Right now he\u2019s in the refrigerator, but the other team\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet me know who\u2019s ahead from time to time, will you?\u201d Hansen heard himself say.\n\u201cGlad to oblige,\u201d the navigator said, yawning again. \u201cOh, incidentally, have they sent for help yet?\u201d\nHansen said with some surprise, \u201cWhy, as a matter of fact, Sector Headquarters is sending some help. How did you know?\u201d\n\u201cBound to happen sooner or later, old man. When the going really gets tough they always get around to sending a Gypsy. Only way to get anything done, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hansen said reluctantly. \u201cWhy is it that everyone knows except me? What, please, is a Gypsy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re too young to know everything, old man,\u201d the navigator said. \u201cYou\u2019re especially too young to know about one of the Federation\u2019s best kept secrets. But you might as well, I suppose. The fact is that a Gypsy is a generally vagrant, dirty, thieving, clever scoundrel who will not work, who has absolutely no respect for order or authority, who believes that our institutions are effete and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut then why\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPatience, patience,\u201d cautioned the navigator, haughtily, \u201cif I am to reveal everything I know, I must do it in my own way. The description I just gave you is not necessarily true. It is simply the way that Sector Headquarters feels about Gypsies. Common jealousy, really. It seems that from time to time, our perfect little galactic society spawns men who don\u2019t care to be cast in the common mold. In short, there are a few men around with brains who don\u2019t think that it means very much to wear pretty uniforms or fancy titles.\u201d\n\u201cUniforms like yours?\u201d asked Hansen.\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d the navigator said sadly. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, of course, that I only play at being a navigator. I couldn\u2019t get this ship off course, if I tried. The same is true with the four engineering officers who stand around watching the Hegler drive units. They occasionally make a ceremonial adjustment, but beyond that, they simply stand around looking pretty.\u201d\n\u201cNo moving parts.\u201d Hansen said.\n\u201cNo moving brains, if you like. Anyway, a Gypsy has\u2014somewhere along the line\u2014learned how to do things. They\u2019ll take an emergency call about once a year\u2014if they happen to feel like it. Then they charge about half a million credits.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean they have an organization, standard rates and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHeavens no!\u201d the navigator said. \u201cThey hate anything that smells like organization. They don\u2019t even specialize in any certain kind of work. One year they\u2019ll be fascinated by sub-nucleonics, the next by horse racing. Very erratic. Can\u2019t keep attention on any one thing. Heard of one once who engaged in fishing and alcohol drinking. Brilliant mathematician, too. But he\u2019d only take a call once every three years or so.\u201d\n\u201cFor a half million credits a crack, eh? You could live pretty well for three years on that.\u201d\n\u201cStrangely enough,\u201d the navigator said thoughtfully, \u201cthey don\u2019t really have any interest in money. If you\u2019d ever met one, you\u2019d know that the high fee is sort of a penalty they mete out to everyone else for being so dumb.\u201d\n\u201cWell, one thing for sure,\u201d Hansen said, \u201cif Bullard and Quemos are the cream of the crop, I\u2019m on the side of the Gypsies.\u201d\n\u201cAh, youth!\u201d the navigator said, \u201cI, too, once had such dreams\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about the dreams,\u201d Hansen said, almost menacingly, \u201cI didn\u2019t spend six years in that damn school just to sit around in a pretty uniform for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll get used to it. In fact, you\u2019ll like it after a while. The home leaves. The fuss your friends will make over you when you step off the ship. The regular and automatic promotions in grade with the extra gold band added to your sleeve; the move from one outpost to an always larger installation. You\u2019ll never do much, of course, but why should you? After all, there aren\u2019t any moving parts.\u201d\nHansen cut the communicator off. He stood there for a moment, feeling depressed and betrayed. Automatically he reached down and flicked imaginary dust from his blue sleeve with its narrow solitary gold band. Ten minutes later the Gypsy\u2019s ship signaled for landing.\nThe man who walked into Hansen\u2019s control room was hardly the ogre he had been prepared for. He looked, Hansen was later to reflect, like Santa Claus with muscles in place of the fat. Wearing an almost unheard of beard and dressed in rough clothes, he walked across the room and made short work of the usual formalities. \u201cName\u2019s Candle,\u201d said the man. \u201cWhere\u2019s those two phonies I\u2019m supposed to replace?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go suit up and go back through the airlock,\u201d Hansen said, motioning to the door. \u201cThey\u2019re in their ship. It\u2019s the one next to yours. Want me to tell them you\u2019re on your way over?\u201d\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d said Candle, grinning, \u201cI\u2019ll surprise \u2019em. Now, suppose you and me sit down and have a little chat.\u201d\nThey sat and Candle pumped Hansen of everything he knew about the entire situation. An hour later, Hansen felt almost as if he had been had. \u201cIs that all?\u201d he asked, wearily.\n\u201cI got the facts,\u201d Candle said. \u201cNow let\u2019s go throw those experts out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite that simple. Neither Bullard nor Quemos had any intention of simply clearing out. \u201cWho the hell you think you are,\u201d Bullard said, \u201cto come over here and order us off? We didn\u2019t even ask for help. And, God knows, you couldn\u2019t supply it anyway.\u201d Bullard, with evident distaste, ran his eyes up and down Candle\u2019s clothing.\nDr. Quemos had some ideas, too. \u201cLetter of authority or no letter of authority,\u201d Quemos said, pointing a manicured forefinger at the paper in Candle\u2019s hand, \u201cyou\u2019ll ruin everything! You have no idea what you\u2019re up against. We\u2019t spent weeks working this thing out\u2014\u201d\nCandle grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you worked out?\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2014why we know that this is a metal double enveloping worm gear.\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d Candle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a single enveloping worm gear. It\u2019s made of steel with an aluminum alloy wheel gear and the two parts have corroded and stuck. The whole mechanism was originally designed for submarines.\u201d\nQuemos started to say something, then turned and looked at Bullard for reassurance. \u201cHe\u2019s crazy,\u201d Bullard said, \u201che\u2019s making it up as he goes along. How could he possibly know what he\u2019s talking about? Why, there haven\u2019t been any submarines for centuries.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of playing games,\u201d Candle said, no longer grinning. \u201cThe boy and I have work to do. You two are in the way. You\u2019ll only take up time if I have to work with you and show you what to do. I want you and your ship out of here in half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to make us?\u201d Bullard asked with great originality.\n\u201cI am.\u201d\nEverybody turned around to see who else had entered the conversation. It was Hansen. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you fifteen minutes, not thirty,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to turn the grid power on at full intensity. You can either use it to take off, or sit around and roast alive inside your ship.\u201d Candle turned and looked at Hansen with new respect. \u201cOkay . . . Let\u2019s go back to your place. I\u2019ve still got some things to figure out.\u201d\nQuemos was on the verge of hysteria. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing! You wouldn\u2019t dare. I\u2019ll report this!\u201d\nFifteen minutes later, the ship headed for space.\nBack in Hansen\u2019s room, the two men ate a quick lunch, then sat at the table and talked about Candle\u2019s plans for opening the reluctant door. \u201cThe way I figure it,\u201d Candle said, \u201cI think that we can handle the whole thing by radio. Which reminds me, one of these days I\u2019m going to build a telescreen that will transmit and receive through pseudo-met. Not too difficult really if you approach the problem\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI better get Fromer for you,\u201d Hansen said hurriedly.\n\u201cFromer here,\u201d said the bass voice.\n\u201cThis is Candle. Let me talk to one of your so-called engineering officers.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up and go get \u2019em,\u201d Candle growled back. \u201cAnd one more yelp out of you and you\u2019ll stay in that ship till you rot.\u201d\nThere was a pause, then Fromer again, a meek Fromer. \u201cMy chief engineering officer is with me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Now get this. Come to think of it, you\u2019d better record it. Number one: By now you know which component is a worm gear. You will notice, I\u2019m quite certain, that it engages a large notched wheel. The reason that the door will not move is because at the point where the two gears meet, some of the metal has oxidized. For possible use in future emergencies, I offer this explanation. The entire mechanism is subject to periodic vacuum, when the airlock door is operated. In between times, the mechanism is in the ship\u2019s atmosphere. A condition of lower oxygen content thus obtains around the sealed off area, and such an area is anodic\u2014in other words, corrodible with respect to the surrounding areas in which oxygen has free access. Now, since this door has opened and closed successfully for about five hundred years, it appears that there\u2019s a special reason why it suddenly refuses to function. At a guess, you would experience this condition of intense corrosion only when the aluminum in the wheel gear is exposed to something like sodium hydroxide, and only at the point where it controls the worm gear. Now, has this ship landed recently within such an atmosphere?\u201d\n\u201cThree weeks ago on Ghortin IV,\u201d said the weak voice of the engineer. \u201cWe landed to get some pictures of the cloud formations for souvenirs. We dropped on the edge of a large body of water because the view was better\u2014\u201d\nCandle shook his head sadly and said, \u201cYou could have avoided trouble by coming in over the land instead of the water. The heat from the ship boiled the water which undoubtedly contained sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide; presto, and the air was filled with clouds of sodium hydroxide.\n\u201cI suggest that you steer away from all such wicked places in the future. Of course, if you\u2019d learn how to mine ore, smelt metal, machine components\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFirst they\u2019d have to discover fire,\u201d Hansen said out of the corner of his mouth.\n\u201cYou\u2019re catching on, son,\u201d Candle said, out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cNow, gentlemen, to open the door it will be necessary to break the corroded area apart. This is a large heavy mechanism, as such things go. Since you have no tools heavy enough to batter the corroded area apart, you\u2019ll have to make some.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we?\u201d\nCandle sighed. \u201cI wish I had time to teach you to think, but instead, you\u2019ll have to do as I tell you to do. I think you can probably make a battering ram out of water. You just\u2014don\u2019t interrupt\u2014find or make a long cylindrical container, fill it with water and quick-freeze it in your refrigerator\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut they put R\u2019thagna Bar in the refrigerator again\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen I suggest you get him the hell out,\u201d Candle said.\nAn hour later ten men smashed a half-ton cylinder of ice against the corroded junction of the two gears. Following Candle\u2019s instructions, they next applied the ram to the door itself, which smoothly swung open. \u201cYou\u2019ll find,\u201d Candle explained, \u201cthat the only damage will be the two missing teeth on the aluminum gear. Since only two teeth are ever in contact at any time, you can simply slide the gear forward and engage it at a point where the teeth are intact. You\u2019ll find, I\u2019m quite sure, that your door will function properly. Also, Captain, don\u2019t pull out of here until I\u2019m aboard. I think I\u2019d like to bring an assistant along, too.\u201d\n\u201cAn assistant?\u201d Hansen asked.\nCandle twirled the ends of his long white moustache. \u201cYou, my lad, if you\u2019d like to go along.\u201d He pulled a letter from his pocket and fanned the air with it. \u201cI\u2019m in complete command of this expedition\u2014at least until His Exalted Excellency gets home to plant his seed.\u201d\nHansen\u2019s face glowed. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather do. Let\u2019s get a couple of messages off to Sector Headquarters and get on board ship.\u201d\n\u201cIt may not be any joy ride,\u201d Candle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t heard about it, but there\u2019ve been a number of ship emergencies in the past few weeks.\u201d\n\u201cDoor failures?\u201d\n\u201cNo. At least none that I\u2019ve heard of. But at least two Hegler drives have stopped working in mid space.\u201d\n\u201cBut, but there\u2019s nothing to stop working\u2014\u201d\nCandle\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cNo moving parts, eh?\u201d\nHansen reddened. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve outgrown that silly notion.\u201d\nCandle peered into Hansen\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have. I\u2019m sure that you will find out a lot more things for yourself. You\u2019re the kind. And we\u2019re going to need a lot of your kind, because failures\u2014failures of so-called perfect mechanisms\u2014are becoming more and more commonplace.\u201d Candle pointed to the emergency light on the traffic control panel. \u201cThat light will be flashing with more and more frequency in the months to come. But not just to signal trouble in space. If I were a superstitious man, I\u2019d think that the age of the perfect machine is about to be superseded by the age of the perfect failure\u2014mechanical failures that can\u2019t be explained on any level. I have several friends who\u2019ve been in touch with me recently about\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think that it\u2019s time for a change?\u201d\nCandle smiled quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea. And the truth of the matter is that I am a superstitious man. I really believe, childishly, that the mechanics and motions of the galaxy may turn themselves upsidedown just to snap man out of his apathy and give him some work to do.\u201d\nUpsidedown turned out to be a good word. They boarded the big ship an hour later and were respectfully ushered into the presence of Captain Fromer and his staff.\n\u201cWe\u2019re underway,\u201d Captain Fromer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be landing in nine days to deliver R\u2019thagna Bar home.\u201d\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d Hansen asked.\nFromer shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s been thawed out, frozen, and thawed out so many times, it\u2019t anybody\u2019s guess. Take a look for yourself.\u201d\nSomeone pulled back a curtain to expose the recumbent, thawing, steamy form of His Exhalted Excellency R\u2019thagna Bar.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s he undressed?\u201d Hansen asked.\n\u201cFunny, now that you mention it,\u201d Fromer said, puzzled, \u201cwhy is he undressed?\u201d\n\u201cFascinating! Damnedest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Candle said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so fascinating?\u201d Fromer asked suspiciously, moving closer.\n\u201cHis belly. Never saw anything like it. Those black squares keep appearing and disappearing. If I\u2019ve ever seen a truly random pattern\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt started right after they froze him the first time,\u201d Fromer said disconsolately.\n\u201cFascinating, by Heaven,\u201d said Candle, who was now down on his hands and knees. \u201cLook at that top sequence! Random, yet physiological. I\u2019ve got a friend on Bridan III who\u2019d trade anything for some photos of this. Get me some photo equipment, will you?\u201d\nCaptain Fromer ran his hands through what was left of his hair. \u201cGet him some photo equipment,\u201d he said to no one in particular, \u201cand somebody make a truce with that idiot doctor long enough to get me a sedative.\u201d About this time the ship turned upsidedown.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for it!\u201d the chief engineer said, running alongside Hansen and Candle. \u201cThe ship can\u2019t turn upsidedown. Everything is functioning perfectly!\u201d\n\u201cReally not interested,\u201d said Candle, running down the corridor\u2019s mile-long ceiling. \u201cFigure something out for yourself for a change.\u201d\n\u201cBut what I can\u2019t understand,\u201d said Hansen, dutifully trotting alongside, \u201cis how you knew with such certainty how the door mechanism was made. Even if submarines were built like that, you\u2019d have no way of knowing. There haven\u2019t been any submarines in centuries.\u201d\n\u201cThe hell you say,\u201d said Candle, increasing his pace, \u201cI built one five years ago.\u201d\n\u201cBuilt one! What for?\u201d\n\u201cFor the hell of it, and it was a damned good outfit, too. I found plans in an old museum, and had the good sense not to improve on \u2019em. Always remember, boy, that something that really works can\u2019t be improved. That\u2019s why the submarine mechanism was adopted\u2014not adapted\u2014for space. The so-called \u2018better way\u2019 they\u2019re building \u2019em today is simply a disguise for the fact that most of the gas is gone from our technology.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to the submarine?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I traded it to a friend for some falcons. You interested in falconry by any chance?\u201d\n\u201cEr, no. Can\u2019t say that I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be,\u201d Candle said prophetically, \u201cyou\u2019ll succumb to every enthusiasm man has ever been deviled with. You\u2019re the type. It\u2019s a disease, boy, and the big symptom isn\u2019t just curiosity, but the kind of intense curiosity that turns you inside out, devours you and ruins you for orthodoxy.\u201d\nHansen had stopped listening. He was absorbed in trying to recall the pattern he had pressed on his radio belt\u2014a pattern never taught to him\u2014when the ship had suddenly turned upsidedown. Hesitantly, he played with the notion that he had been thinking of the ship traveling upsidedown at the time he impressed the novel pattern on the belt. Now, could that have possibly . . . ?\nThe man and the boy disappeared down the ceiling, running at top speed to catch up as the rapidly vanishing form of R\u2019thagna Bar was dragged and pulled relentlessly toward the refrigerator in a tug of war between the ship\u2019s wild, divided crew.\n\u201cFascinating!\u201d said Candle. His eyes, glittering with their own peculiar madness, remained riveted on the distant imperial belly. \u201cNever saw anything like it!\u201d\n"

                "content": "\n\u2018Halloa! Below there!\u2019\nWhen he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its short pole. One would have thought, considering the nature of the ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter the voice came; but, instead of looking up to where I stood on the top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself about and looked down the Line. There was something remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could not have said, for my life, what. But, I know it was remarkable enough to attract my notice, even though his figure was foreshortened and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was high above him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset that I had shaded my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.\n\u2018Halloa! Below!\u2019\nFrom looking down the Line, he turned himself about again, and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.\n\u2018Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to you?\u2019\nHe looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then, there came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train, had passed me and was skimming away over the landscape, I looked down again, and saw him re-furling the flag he had shown while the train went by.\nI repeated my inquiry. After a pause, during which he seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his rolled-up flag towards a point on my level, some two or three hundred yards distant. I called down to him, \u2018All right!\u2019 and made for that point. There, by dint of looking closely about me, I found a rough zig-zag descending path notched out: which I followed.\nThe cutting was extremely deep, and unusually precipitate. It was made through a clammy stone that became oozier and wetter as I went down. For these reasons, I found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the path.\nWhen I came down low enough upon the zig-zag descent, to see him again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by which the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were waiting for me to appear. He had his left hand at his chin, and that left elbow rested on his right hand crossed over his breast. His attitude was one of such expectation and watchfulness, that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.\nI resumed my downward way, and, stepping out upon the level of the railroad and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark sallow man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows. His post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever I saw. On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone, excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way, only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter perspective in the other direction, terminating in a gloomy red light, and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and forbidding air. So little sunlight ever found its way to this spot, that it had an earthy deadly smell; and so much cold wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I had left the natural world.\nBefore he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched him. Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped back one step, and lifted his hand.\nThis was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder. A visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity, I hoped? In me, he merely saw a man who had been shut up within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works. To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the terms I used, for, besides that I am not happy in opening any conversation, there was something in the man that daunted me.\nHe directed a most curious look towards the red light near the tunnel\u2019s mouth, and looked all about it, as if something were missing from it, and then looked at me.\nThat light was part of his charge? Was it not?\nHe answered in a low voice: \u2018Don\u2019t you know it is?\u2019\nThe monstrous thought came into my mind as I perused the fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a man. I have speculated since, whether there may have been infection in his mind.\nIn my turn, I stepped back. But in making the action, I detected in his eyes some latent fear of me. This put the monstrous thought to flight.\n\u201cYou look at me,\u201d I said, forcing a smile, \u2018as if you had a dread of me.\u2019\n\u2018I was doubtful,\u2019 he returned, \u2018whether I had seen you before.\u2019\n\u2018Where?\u2019\nHe pointed to the red light he had looked at.\n\u2018There?\u2019 I said.\nIntently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound), Yes.\n\u2018My good fellow, what should I do there? However, be that as it may, I never was there, you may swear.\u2019\n\u2018I think I may,\u2019 he rejoined. \u2018Yes. I am sure I may.\u2019\nHis manner cleared, like my own. He replied to my remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words. Had he much to do there? Yes; that was to say, he had enough responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were what was required of him, and of actual work\u2014manual labour he had next to none. To change that signal, to trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was all he had to do under that head. Regarding those many long and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could only say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that form, and he had grown used to it. He had taught himself a language down here\u2014if only to know it by sight, and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be called learning it. He had also worked at fractions and decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as a boy, a poor hand at figures. Was it necessary for him when on duty, always to remain in that channel of damp air, and could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high stone walls? Why, that depended upon times and circumstances. Under some conditions there would be less upon the Line than under others, and the same held good as to certain hours of the day and night. In bright weather, he did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.\nHe took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an official book in which he had to make certain entries, a telegraphic instrument with its dial face and needles, and the little bell of which he had spoken. On my trusting that he would excuse the remark that he had been well-educated, and (I hoped I might say without offence), perhaps educated above that station, he observed that instances of slight incongruity in such-wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men; that he had heard it was so in workhouses, in the police force, even in that last desperate resource, the army; and that he knew it was so, more or less, in any great railway staff. He had been, when young (if I could believe it, sitting in that, hut; he scarcely could), a student of natural philosophy, and had attended lectures; but he had run wild, misused his opportunities, gone down, and never risen again. He had no complaint to offer about that. He had made his bed and he lay upon it. It was far too late to make another.\nAll that I have here condensed, he said in a quiet manner, with his grave dark regards divided between me and the fire. He threw in the word \u2018Sir\u2019 from time to time, and especially when he referred to his youth: as though to request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I found him. He was several times interrupted by the little bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies. Once, he had to stand without the door, and display a flag as a train passed, and make some verbal communication to the driver. In the discharge of his duties I observed him to be remarkably exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and remaining silent until what he had to do was done.\nIn a word, I should have set this man down as one of the safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off with a fallen colour, turned his face towards the little bell when it did NOT ring, opened the door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy damp), and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the tunnel. On both of those occasions, he came back to the fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had remarked, without being able to define, when we were so far asunder.\nSaid I when I rose to leave him: \u2018You almost make me think that I have met with a contented man.\u2019\n(I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead him on.)\n\u2018I believe I used to be so,\u2019 he rejoined, in the low voice in which he had first spoken; \u2018but I am troubled, sir, I am troubled.\u2019\nHe would have recalled the words if he could. He had said them, however, and I took them up quickly.\n\u2018With what? What is your trouble?\u2019\n\u2018It is very difficult to impart, sir. It is very, very difficult to speak of. If ever you make me another visit, I will try to tell you.\u2019\n\u2018But I expressly intend to make you another visit. Say, when shall it be?\u2019\n\u2018I go off early in the morning, and I shall be on again at ten to-morrow night, sir.\u2019\n\u2018I will come at eleven.\u2019\nHe thanked me, and went out at the door with me.\n\u2018I\u2019ll show my white light, sir,\u2019 he said, in his peculiar low voice, \u2018till you have found the way up. When you have found it, don\u2019t call out! And when you are at the top, don\u2019t call out!\u2019\nHis manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me, but I said no more than \u2018Very well.\u2019\n\u2018And when you come down to-morrow night, don\u2019t call out! Let me ask you a parting question. What made you cry \u2018Halloa! Below there!\u2019 to-night?\u2019\n\u2018Heaven knows,\u2019 said I. \u2018I cried something to that effect\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Not to that effect, sir. Those were the very words. I know them well.\u2019\n\u2018Admit those were the very words. I said them, no doubt, because I saw you below.\u2019\n\u2018For no other reason?\u2019\n\u2018What other reason could I possibly have!\u2019\n\u2018You had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in any supernatural way?\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nHe wished me good night, and held up his light. I walked by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable sensation of a train coming behind me), until I found the path. It was easier to mount than to descend, and I got back to my inn without any adventure.\nPunctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the first notch of the zig-zag next night, as the distant clocks were striking eleven. He was waiting for me at the bottom, with his white light on. \u2018I have not called out,\u2019 I said, when we came close together; \u2018may I speak now?\u2019 \u2018By all means, sir.\u2019 \u2018Good night then, and here\u2019s my hand.\u2019 \u2018Good night, sir, and here\u2019s mine.\u2019 With that, we walked side by side to his box, entered it, closed the door, and sat down by the fire.\n\u2018I have made up my mind, sir,\u2019 he began, bending forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a little above a whisper, \u2018that you shall not have to ask me twice what troubles me. I took you for someone else yesterday evening. That troubles me.\u2019\n\u2018That mistake?\u2019\n\u2018No. That someone else.\u2019\n\u2018Who is it?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018Like me?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. I never saw the face. The left arm is across the face, and the right arm is waved. Violently waved. This way.\u2019\nI followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of an arm gesticulating with the utmost passion and vehemence: \u2018For God\u2019s sake clear the way!\u2019\n\u2018One moonlight night,\u2019 said the man, \u2018I was sitting here, when I heard a voice cry \u201cHalloa! Below there!\u201d I started up, looked from that door, and saw this Some one else standing by the red light near the tunnel, waving as I just now showed you. The voice seemed hoarse with shouting, and it cried, \u201cLook out! Look out!\u201d And then again \u201cHalloa! Below there! Look out!\u201d I caught up my lamp, turned it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What has happened? Where?\u201d It stood just outside the blackness of the tunnel. I advanced so close upon it that I wondered at its keeping the sleeve across its eyes. I ran right up at it, and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when it was gone.\u2019\n\u2018Into the tunnel,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018No. I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred yards. I stopped and held my lamp above my head, and saw the figures of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains stealing down the walls and trickling through the arch. I ran out again, faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal abhorrence of the place upon me), and I looked all round the red light with my own red light, and I went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop of it, and I came down again, and ran back here. I telegraphed both ways, \u201cAn alarm has been given. Is anything wrong?\u201d The answer came back, both ways: \u201cAll well.\u201d\u2019\nResisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a deception of his sense of sight, and how that figures, originating in disease of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye, were known to have often troubled patients, some of whom had become conscious of the nature of their affliction, and had even proved it by experiments upon themselves. \u2018As to an imaginary cry,\u2019 said I, \u2018do but listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low, and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires!\u2019\nThat was all very well, he returned, after we had sat listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind and the wires, he who so often passed long winter nights there, alone and watching. But he would beg to remark that he had not finished.\nI asked his pardon, and he slowly added these words, touching my arm: \u2018Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where the figure had stood.\u2019\nA disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best against it. It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his mind. But it was unquestionable that remarkable coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken into account in dealing with such a subject. Though to be sure I must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was going to bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations of life.\nHe again begged to remark that he had not finished.\nI again begged his pardon for being betrayed into interruptions.\n\u2018This,\u2019 he said, again laying his hand upon my arm, and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, \u2018was just a year ago. Six or seven months passed, and I had recovered from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the day was breaking, I, standing at that door, looked towards the red light, and saw the spectre again.\u2019 He stopped, with a fixed look at me.\n\u2018Did it cry out?\u2019\n\u2018No. It was silent.\u2019\n\u2018Did it wave its arm?\u2019\n\u2018No. It leaned against the shaft of the light, with both hands before the face. Like this.\u2019\nOnce more, I followed his action with my eyes. It was an action of mourning. I have seen such an attitude in stone figures on tombs.\n\u2018Did you go up to it?\u2019\n\u2018I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts, partly because it had turned me faint. When I went to the door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was gone.\u2019\n\u2018But nothing followed? Nothing came of this?\u2019\nHe touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice, giving a ghastly nod each time: \u2018That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like a confusion of hands and heads, and something waved. I saw it, just in time to signal the driver, Stop! He shut off, and put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a hundred and fifty yards or more. I ran after it, and, as I went along, heard terrible screams and cries. A beautiful young lady had died instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was brought in here, and laid down on this floor between us.\u2019\nInvoluntarily, I pushed my chair back, as I looked from the boards at which he pointed, to himself.\n\u2018True, sir. True. Precisely as it happened, so I tell it you.\u2019\nI could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth was very dry. The wind and the wires took up the story with a long lamenting wail.\nHe resumed. \u2018Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my mind is troubled. The spectre came back, a week ago. Ever since, it has been there, now and again, by fits and starts.\u2019\n\u2018At the light?\u2019\n\u2018At the Danger-light.\u2019\n\u2018What does it seem to do?\u2019\nHe repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence, that former gesticulation of \u2018For God\u2019s sake clear the way!\u2019\nThen, he went on. \u2018I have no peace or rest for it. It calls to me, for many minutes together, in an agonised manner, \u201cBelow there! Look out! Look out!\u201d It stands waving to me. It rings my little bell\u2014\u2014\u2019\nI caught at that. \u2018Did it ring your bell yesterday evening when I was here, and you went to the door?\u2019\n\u2018Twice.\u2019\n\u2018Why, see,\u2019 said I, \u2018how your imagination misleads you. My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were open to the bell, and if I am a living man, it did NOT ring at those times. No, nor at any other time, except when it was rung in the natural course of physical things by the station communicating with you.\u2019\nHe shook his head. \u2018I have never made a mistake as to that, yet, sir. I have never confused the spectre\u2019s ring with the man\u2019s. The ghost\u2019s ring is a strange vibration in the bell that it derives from nothing else, and I have not asserted that the bell stirs to the eye. I don\u2019t wonder that you failed to hear it. But I heard it.\u2019\n\u2018And did the spectre seem to be there, when you looked out?\u2019\n\u2018It WAS there.\u2019\n\u2018Both times?\u2019\nHe repeated firmly: \u2018Both times.\u2019\n\u2018Will you come to the door with me, and look for it now?\u2019\nHe bit his under-lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but arose. I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he stood in the doorway. There, was the Danger-light. There, was the dismal mouth of the tunnel. There, were the high wet stone walls of the cutting. There, were the stars above them.\n\u2018Do you see it?\u2019 I asked him, taking particular note of his face. His eyes were prominent and strained; but not very much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had directed them earnestly towards the same spot.\n\u2018No,\u2019 he answered. \u2018It is not there.\u2019\n\u2018Agreed,\u2019 said I.\nWe went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats. I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be called one, when he took up the conversation in such a matter of course way, so assuming that there could be no serious question of fact between us, that I felt myself placed in the weakest of positions.\n\u2018By this time you will fully understand, sir,\u2019 he said, \u2018that what troubles me so dreadfully, is the question, What does the spectre mean?\u2019\nI was not sure, I told him, that I did fully understand.\n\u2018What is its warning against?\u2019 he said, ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning them on me. \u2018What is the danger? Where is the danger? There is danger overhanging, somewhere on the Line. Some dreadful calamity will happen. It is not to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before. But surely this is a cruel haunting of me. What can I do?\u2019\nHe pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from his heated forehead.\n\u2018If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on both, I can give no reason for it,\u2019 he went on, wiping the palms of his hands. \u2018I should get into trouble, and do no good. They would think I was mad. This is the way it would work:\u2014Message: \u201cDanger! Take care!\u201d Answer: \u201cWhat danger? Where?\u201d Message: \u201cDon\u2019t know. But for God\u2019s sake take care!\u201d They would displace me. What else could they do?\u2019\nHis pain of mind was most pitiable to see. It was the mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.\n\u2018When it first stood under the Danger-light,\u2019 he went on, putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing his hands outward across and across his temples in an extremity of feverish distress, \u2018why not tell me where that accident was to happen\u2014if it must happen? Why not tell me how it could be averted\u2014if it could have been averted? When on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me instead: \u201cShe is going to die. Let them keep her at home\u201d? If it came, on those two occasions, only to show me that its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the third, why not warn me plainly now? And I, Lord help me! A mere poor signalman on this solitary station! Why not go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to act!\u2019\nWhen I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor man\u2019s sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to do for the time was, to compose his mind. Therefore, setting aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty, must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he understood his duty, though he did not understand these confounding Appearances. In this effort I succeeded far better than in the attempt to reason him out of his conviction. He became calm; the occupations incidental to his post as the night advanced, began to make larger demands on his attention; and I left him at two in the morning. I had offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of it.\nThat I more than once looked back at the red light as I ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see no reason to conceal. Nor, did I like the two sequences of the accident and the dead girl. I see no reason to conceal that, either.\nBut, what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how ought I to act, having become the recipient of this disclosure? I had proved the man to be intelligent, vigilant, painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain so, in his state of mind? Though in a subordinate position, still he held a most important trust, and would I (for instance) like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to execute it with precision?\nUnable to overcome a feeling that there would be something treacherous in my communicating what he had told me, to his superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in those parts, and to take his opinion. A change in his time of duty would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he would be off an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon after sunset. I had appointed to return accordingly.\nNext evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to enjoy it. The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed the field-path near the top of the deep cutting. I would extend my walk for an hour, I said to myself, half an hour on and half an hour back, and it would then be time to go to my signalman\u2019s box.\nBefore pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and mechanically looked down, from the point from which I had first seen him. I cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me, when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a man, with his left sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving his right arm.\nThe nameless horror that oppressed me, passed in a moment, for in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed, and that there was a little group of other men standing at a short distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he made. The Danger-light was not yet lighted. Against its shaft, a little low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of some wooden supports and tarpaulin. It looked no bigger than a bed.\nWith an irresistible sense that something was wrong\u2014with a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal mischief had come of my leaving the man there, and causing no one to be sent to overlook or correct what he did\u2014I descended the notched path with all the speed I could make.\n\u2018What is the matter?\u2019 I asked the men.\n\u2018Signalman killed this morning, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Not the man belonging to that box?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Not the man I know?\u2019\n\u2018You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,\u2019 said the man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his own head and raising an end of the tarpaulin, \u2018for his face is quite composed.\u2019\n\u2018O! how did this happen, how did this happen?\u2019 I asked, turning from one to another as the hut closed in again.\n\u2018He was cut down by an engine, sir. No man in England knew his work better. But somehow he was not clear of the outer rail. It was just at broad day. He had struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand. As the engine came out of the tunnel, his back was towards her, and she cut him down. That man drove her, and was showing how it happened. Show the gentleman, Tom.\u2019\nThe man, who wore a rough dark dress, stepped back to his former place at the mouth of the tunnel!\n\u2018Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,\u2019 he said, \u2018I saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a perspective-glass. There was no time to check speed, and I knew him to be very careful. As he didn\u2019t seem to take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were running down upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.\u2019\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019\n\u2018I said, Below there! Look out! Look out! For God\u2019s sake clear the way!\u2019\nI started.\n\u2018Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir. I never left off calling to him. I put this arm before my eyes, not to see, and I waved this arm to the last; but it was no use.\u2019\nWithout prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate Signalman had repeated to me as haunting him, but also the words which I myself\u2014not he\u2014had attached, and that only in my own mind, to the gesticulation he had imitated.\n"

We see them in the museum cases, sorted out in accordance with principles we do not understand, labelled with strange names. Chellean, Mousterian, Solutrian and the like, taken mostly from the places Chelles, La Moustier, Solutre, and so forth where the first specimens were found. Most of us stare through the glass at them, wonder vaguely for a moment at that half-savage, half-animal past of our race, and pass on. Primitive man, we say. Flint implements. The mammoth used to chase him. Few of us realise yet how much the subtle indefatigable cross-examination of the scientific worker has been extracting from the evidence of these rusty and obstinate witnesses during the last few years.\nOne of the most startling results of this recent work is the gradual realisation that great quantities of these flint implements and some of the earlier fragments of bone that used to be ascribed to humanity are the vestiges of creatures, very manlike in many respects, but not, strictly speaking, belonging to the human species. Scientific men call these vanished races man (Homo), just as they call lions and tigers cats (Felis), but there are the soundest reasons for believing that these earlier so-called men were not of our blood, not our ancestors, but a strange and vanished animal, like us, akin to us, but different from us, as the mammoth was like, and akin to, and yet different from, the elephant. Flint and bone implements are found in deposits of very considerable antiquity; some in our museums may be a million years old or more, but the traces of really human creatures, mentally and anatomically like ourselves, do not go back much earlier than twenty or thirty thousand years ago. True men appeared in Europe then, and we do not know whence they came. These other tool-using, fire-making animals, the things that were like men and yet were not men, passed away before the faces of the true men.\nScientific authorities already distinguish four species of these pseudo-men, and it is probable that we shall learn from time to time of other species. One strange breed made the implements called Chellean. These are chiefly sole-shaped blades of stone found in deposits of perhaps 300,000 or 400,000 years ago. Chellean implements are to be seen in any great museum. They are huge implements, four or five times as big as those made by any known race of true men, and they are not ill made. Certainly some creature with an intelligent brain made them. Big clumsy hands must have gripped and used these rocky chunks. But so far only one small fragment of a skeleton of this age has been found, a very massive chinless lower jawbone, with teeth rather more specialised than those of men to-day. We can only guess what strange foreshadowing of the human form once ate with that jaw, and struck at its enemies with those big but not unhandy flint blades. It may have been a tremendous fellow, probably much bigger in the body than a man. It may have been able to take bears by the scruff and the sabre-toothed lion by the throat. We do not know. We have just these great stone blades and that bit of a massive jaw and\u2014the liberty to wonder.\nMost fascinating riddle of all these riddles of the ages of ice and hardship, before the coming of the true men, is the riddle of the Mousterian men, because they were perhaps still living in the world when the true man came wandering into Europe. They lived much later than those unknown Chellean giants. They lived thirty or forty thousand years ago\u2014a yesterday compared with the Chellean time. These Mousterians are also called Neandertalers. Until quite recently it was supposed that they were true men like ourselves. But now we begin to realise that they were different, so different that it is impossible that they can be very close relations of ours. They walked or shambled along with a peculiar slouch, they could not turn their heads up to the sky, and their teeth were very different from those of true men. One oddity about them is that in one or two points they were less like apes than we are. The dog tooth, the third tooth from the middle, which is so big in the gorilla, and which in man is pointed and still quite distinct from the other teeth, is not distinct at all in the Neandertaler. He had a very even row of teeth, and his cheek teeth also were very unlike ours, and less like the apes\u2019 than ours. He had more face and less brow than true men, but that is not because he had a lesser brain; his brain was as big as a modern man\u2019s but it was different, bigger behind and smaller in front, so that probably he thought and behaved differently from us. Perhaps he had a better memory and less reasoning power than real men, or perhaps he had more nervous energy and less intelligence. He had no chin, and the way his jawbones come together below make it very doubtful if he could have used any such sounds in speech as we employ. Probably he did not talk at all. He could not hold a pin between his finger and thumb. The more we learn about this beast-man the stranger he becomes to us and the less like the Australoid savage he was once supposed to be.\nAnd as we realise the want of any close relationship between this ugly, strong, ungainly, manlike animal and mankind, the less likely it becomes that he had a naked skin and hair like ours and the more probable that he was different, and perhaps bristly or hairy in some queer inhuman fashion like the hairy elephant and the woolly rhinoceros who were his contemporaries. Like them he lived in a bleak land on the edge of the snows and glaciers that were even then receding northward. Hairy or grisly, with a big face like a mask, great brow ridges and no forehead, clutching an enormous flint, and running like a baboon with his head forward and not, like a man, with his head up, he must have been a fearsome creature for our forefathers to come upon.\nAlmost certainly they met, these grisly men and the true men. The true man must have come into the habitat of the Neandertaler, and the two must have met and fought. Some day we may come upon the evidences of this warfare.\nWestern Europe, which is the only part of the world that has yet been searched with any thoroughness for the remains of early men, was slowly growing warmer age by age; the glaciers that had once covered half the continent were receding, and wide stretches of summer pasture and thin woods of pine and birch were spreading slowly over the once icy land. South Europe then was like northern Labrador to-day. A few hardy beasts held out amidst the snows; the bears hibernated. With the spring grass and foliage came great herds of reindeer, wild horses, mammoth, elephant, and rhinoceros, drifting northward from the slopes of the great warm valley that is now filled up with water\u2014the Mediterranean Sea. It was in those days before the ocean waters broke into the Mediterranean that the swallows and a multitude of other birds acquired the habit of coming north, a habit that nowadays impels them to brave the passage of the perilous seas that flow over and hide the lost secrets of the ancient Mediterranean valleys. The grisly men rejoiced at the return of life, came out of the caves in which they had lurked during the winter, and took their toll of the beasts.\nThese grisly men must have been almost solitary creatures.\nThe winter food was too scanty for communities. A male may have gone with a female or so; perhaps they parted in the winter and came together in the summer; when his sons grew big enough to annoy him, the grisly man killed them or drove them off. If he killed them he may have eaten them. If they escaped him they may have returned to kill him. The grisly folk may have had long unreasoning memories and very set purposes.\nThe true men came into Europe, we know not whence, out of the South. When they appeared in Europe their hands were as clever as ours; they could draw pictures we still admire, they could paint and carve; the implements they made were smaller than the Mousterian ones, far smaller than the Chellean, but better made and more various. They wore no clothes worth speaking of, but they painted themselves and probably they talked. And they came in little bands. They were already more social than the Neandertaler; they had laws and self-restraints; their minds had travelled a long way along that path of adaptation and self-suppression which has led to the intricate mind of man to-day with its concealed wishes, its confusions, and laughter and the fantasies and reveries and dreams. They were already held together, these men, and kept in order by the strange limitations of tabu.\nThey were still savages, very prone to violence and convulsive in their lusts and desires; but to the best of their poor ability they obeyed laws and customs already immemorably ancient, and they feared the penalties of wrong-doing. We can understand something of what was going on in their minds, those of us who can remember the fears, desires, fancies and superstitions of our childhood. Their moral struggles were ours\u2014in cruder forms. They were our kind. But the grisly folk we cannot begin to understand. We cannot conceive in our different minds the strange ideas that chased one another through those queerly shaped brains. As well might we try to dream and feel as a gorilla dreams and feels.\nWe can understand how the true men drifted northward from the lost lands of the Mediterranean valley into the high Spanish valleys and the south and centre of France, and so on to what is now England\u2014for there was no Channel then between England and France\u2014and eastward to the Rhineland and over the broad wilderness which is now the North Sea, and the German plain. They would leave the snowy wilderness of the Alps, far higher then and covered with great glaciers, away on their right. These people drifted northward for the very good reason that their kind was multiplying and food diminishing. They would be oppressed by feuds and wars. They had no settled homes; they were accustomed to drift with the seasons, every now and then some band would be pushed by hunger and fear a little farther northward into the unknown.\nWe can imagine the appearance of a little group of these wanderers, our ancestors, coming over some grassy crest into these northern lands. The time would be late spring or early summer, and they would probably be following up some grazing beasts, a reindeer herd or horses.\nBy a score of different means our anthropologists have been able to reconstruct the particulars of the appearance and habits of these early pilgrim fathers of mankind.\nThey would not be a very numerous band, because if they were there would be no reason why they should have been driven northward out of their former roving grounds. Two or three older men of thirty or so, eight or ten women and girls with a few young children, a few lads between fourteen and twenty, might make up the whole community. They would be a brownish brown-eyed people with wavy dark hair; the fairness of the European and the straight blue-black hair of the Chinaman had still to be evolved in the world. The older men would probably lead the band, the women and children would keep apart from the youths and men, fenced off by complex and definite tabus from any close companionship. The leaders would be tracking the herd they were following. Tracking was then the supreme accomplishment of mankind. By signs and traces that would be invisible to any modern civilised eye, they would be reading the story of the previous day\u2019s trek of the herd of sturdy little horses ahead of them. They would be so expert that they would go on from one faint sign to another with as little delay as a dog who follows a scent.\nThe horses they were following were only a little way ahead\u2014so the trackers read the signs\u2014they were numerous and nothing had alarmed them. They were grazing and moving only very slowly. There were no traces of wild dog or other enemies to stampede them. Some elephants were also going north, and twice our human tribe had crossed the spoor of woolly rhinoceros roaming westward.\nThe tribe travelled light. They were mainly naked, but all of them were painted with white and black and red and yellow ochre. At this distance of time it is difficult to see whether they were tattooed. Probably they were not. The babies and small children were carried by the women on their backs in slings or bags made of animal skins, and perhaps some or all of them wore mantles and loin bands of skin and had pouches and belts of leather. The men had stone-pointed spears, and carried sharpened flints in their hands.\nThere was no Old Man who was lord and master and father of this particular crowd. Weeks ago the Old Man had been charged and trampled to a jelly by a great bull in the swamp far away. Then two of the girls had been waylaid and carried off by the young men of another larger tribe. It was because of these losses that this remnant was now seeking new hunting grounds.\nThe landscape that spread before the eyes of this little band as they crested the hill was a bleaker, more desolate and altogether unkempt version of the landscape of western Europe to-day. About them was a grassy down athwart which a peewit flew with its melancholy cry. Before them stretched a great valley ridged with transverse purple hills over which the April cloud-shadows chased one another. Pinewoods and black heather showed where these hills became sandy, and the valleys were full of brown brushwood, and down their undrained troughs ran a bright green band of peaty swamps and long pools of weedy water. In the valley thickets many beasts lurked unseen, and where the winding streams had cut into the soil there were cliffs and caves. Far away along the northern slopes of the ridge that were now revealed, the wild ponies were to be seen grazing.\nAt a sign from the two leaders the little straggle of menfolk halted, and a woman who had been chattering in subdued tones to a little girl became silent. The brothers surveyed the wide prospect earnestly.\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said one abruptly and pointed.\n\u201cUgh!\u201d cried his brother.\nThe eyes of the whole tribe swung round to the pointing finger.\nThe group became one rigid stare.\nEvery soul of them stood still, astonishment had turned them into a tense group of statuettes.\nFar away down the slope with his body in profile and his head turned towards them, frozen by an equal amazement, stood a hunched grey figure, bigger but shorter than a man. He had been creeping up behind a fold in the ground to peer at the ponies; and suddenly he had turned his eyes and seen the tribe. His head projected like a baboon\u2019s. In his hand he carried what seemed to the menfolk a great rock.\nFor a little while this animal scrutiny held discoverers and discovered motionless. Then some of the women and children began to stir and line out to see the strange creature better. \u201cMan!\u201d said an old crone of forty. \u201cMan!\u201d At the movement of the women the grisly man turned, ran clumsily for a score of yards or so towards a thicket of birch and budding thorn. Then he halted again for a moment to look at the newcomers, waved an arm strangely, and then dashed into cover.\nThe shadows of the thicket swallowed him up, and by hiding him seemed to make him enormous. It identified itself with him, and watched them with his eyes. Its tree stems became long silvery limbs, and a fallen trunk crouched and stared.\nIt was still early in the morning, and the leaders of the tribe had hoped to come up with the wild ponies as the day advanced and perhaps cut one off and drive it into difficulties among the bushes and swampy places below, and wound it and follow it up and kill it. Then they would have made a feast, and somewhere down in the valley they would have found water and dry bracken for litter and a fire before night. It had seemed a pleasant and hopeful morning to them until this moment. Now they were disconcerted. This grey figure was as if the sunny morning had suddenly made a horrible and inexplicable grimace.\nThe whole expedition stood gazing for a time, and then the two leaders exchanged a few words. Waugh, the elder, pointed. Click, his brother, nodded his head. They would go on, but instead of slanting down the slopes towards the thickets they would keep round the ridge.\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Waugh, and the little band began to move again. But now it marched in silence. When presently a little boy began a question his mother silenced him by a threat. Everybody kept glancing at the thickets below.\nPresently a girl cried out sharply and pointed. All started and stopped short.\nThere was the grisly thing again. It was running across an open space, running almost on all fours, in joltering leaps. It was hunchbacked and very big and low, a grey hairy wolf-like monster. At times its long arms nearly touched the ground. It was nearer than it had been before. It vanished amidst the bushes again. It seemed to throw itself down among some red dead bracken...\nWaugh and Click took counsel.\nA mile away was the head of the valley where the thickets had their beginning. Beyond stretched the woldy hills, bare of cover. The horses were grazing up towards the sun, and away to the north the backs of a herd of woolly rhinoceros were now visible on a crest\u2014just the ridges of their backs showing like a string of black beads.\nIf the tribe struck across those grassy spaces, then the lurking prowler would have either to stay behind or come into the open. If he came into the open the dozen youths and men of the tribe would know how to deal with him.\nSo they struck across the grass. The little band worked round to the head of the valley, and there the menfolk stayed at the crest while the women and children pushed on ahead across the open.\nFor a time the watchers remained motionless, and then Waugh was moved to gestures of defiance. Click was not to be outdone. There were shouts at the hidden watcher, and then one lad, who was something of a clown, after certain grimaces and unpleasant gestures, obliged with an excellent imitation of the grey thing\u2019s lumbering run. At that, scare gave place to hilarity.\nIn those days laughter was a social embrace. Men could laugh, but there was no laughter in the grisly pre-man who watched and wondered in the shadow. He marvelled. The men rolled about and guffawed and slapped their thighs and one another. Tears ran down their faces.\nNever a sign came from the thickets.\n\u201cYahah,\u201d said the menfolk. \u201cYahah! Bzzzz. Yahah! Yah!\u201d\nThey forgot altogether how frightened they had been.\nAnd when Waugh thought the women and children had gone on a sufficient distance, he gave the word for the men to follow them.\nIn some such fashion it was that men, our ancestors, had their first glimpse of the pre-men of the wilderness of western Europe.\nThe two breeds were soon to come to closer quarters.\nThe newcomers were pushing their way into the country of these grisly men. Presently came other glimpses of lurking semi-human shapes and grey forms that ran in the twilight. In the morning Click found long narrow footprints round the camp...\nThen one day, one of the children, eating those little green thorn-buds that rustic English children speak of as bread and cheese, ventured too far from the others. There was a squeal and a scuffle and a thud, and something grey and hairy made off through the thickets carrying its victim, with Waugh and three of the younger men in hot pursuit. They chased the enemy into a dark gully, very much overgrown. This time it was not a solitary Neandertaler they had to deal with. Out of the bushes a big male came at them to cover the retreat of his mate, and hurled a rock that bowled over the youth it hit like a nine-pin, so that thereafter he limped always. But Waugh with his throwing spear got the grey monster in the shoulder, and he halted snarling.\nNo further sound came from the stolen child.\nThe female showed herself for a moment up the gully, snarling, bloodstained, and horrible, and the menfolk stood about afraid to continue their pursuit, and yet not caring to desist from it. One of them was already hobbling off with his hand to his knee.\nHow did that first fight go?\nPerhaps it went against the men of our race. Perhaps the big Neandertaler male, his mane and beard bristling horribly, came down the gully with a thunderous roar, with a great rock in either hand. We do not know whether he threw those big discs of flint or whether he smote with them. Perhaps it was then that Waugh was killed in the act of running away. Perhaps it was bleak disaster then for the little tribe. Short of two of its members it presently made off over the hills as fast as it could go, keeping together for safety, and leaving the wounded youth far behind to limp along its tracks in lonely terror.\nLet us suppose that he got back to the tribe at last\u2014after nightmare hours.\nNow that Waugh had gone, Click would become Old Man, and he made the tribe camp that night and build their fire on the high ridges among the heather far away from the thickets in which the grisly folk might be lurking.\nThe grisly folk thought we knew not how about the menfolk, and the men thought about the grisly folk in such ways as we can understand; they imagined how their enemies might act in this fashion or that, and schemed to circumvent them. It may have been Click who had the first dim idea of getting at the gorge in which the Neandertalers had their lair, from above. For as we have said, the Neandertaler did not look up. Then the menfolk could roll a great rock upon him or pelt him with burning brands and set the dry bracken alight.\nOne likes to think of a victory for the human side. This Click we have conjured up had run in panic from the first onset of the grisly male, but as he brooded by the fire that night, he heard again in imagination the cry of the lost girl, and he was filled with rage. In his sleep the grisly male came to him and Click fought in his dreams and started awake stiff with fury. There was a fascination for him in that gorge in which Waugh had been killed. He was compelled to go back and look again for the grisly beasts, to waylay them in their tracks, and watch them from an ambush. He perceived that the Neandertalers could not climb as easily as the menfolk could climb, nor hear so quickly, nor dodge with the same unexpectedness. These grisly men were to be dealt with as the bears were dealt with, the bears before whom you run and scatter, and then come at again from behind.\nBut one may doubt if the first human group to come into the grisly land was clever enough to solve the problems of the new warfare. Maybe they turned southward again to the gentler regions from which they had come, and were killed by or mingled with their own brethren again. Maybe they perished altogether in that new land of the grisly folk into which they had intruded. Yet the truth may be that they even held their own and increased. If they died there were others of their kind to follow them and achieve a better fate.\nThat was the beginning of a nightmare age for the little children of the human tribe. They knew they were watched.\nTheir steps were dogged. The legends of ogres and man-eating giants that haunt the childhood of the world may descend to us from those ancient days of fear. And for the Neandertalers it was the beginning of an incessant war that could end only in extermination.\nThe Neandertalers, albeit not so erect and tall as men, were the heavier, stronger creatures, but they were stupid, and they went alone or in twos and threes; the menfolk were swifter, quicker-witted, and more social\u2014when they fought they fought in combination. They lined out and surrounded and pestered and pelted their antagonists from every side. They fought the men of that grisly race as dogs might fight a bear. They shouted to one another what each should do, and the Neandertaler had no speech; he did not understand. They moved too quickly for him and fought too cunningly.\nMany and obstinate were the duels and battles these two sorts of men fought for this world in that bleak age of the windy steppes, thirty or forty thousand years ago. The two races were intolerable to each other. They both wanted the caves and the banks by the rivers where the big flints were got. They fought over the dead mammoths that had been bogged in the marshes, and over the reindeer stags that had been killed in the rutting season. When a human tribe found signs of the grisly folk near their cave and squatting place, they had perforce to track them down and kill them; their own safety and the safety of their little ones was only to be secured by that killing. The Neandertalers thought the little children of men fair game and pleasant eating.\nHow long the grisly folk lived on in that chill world of pines and silver birch between the steppes and the glaciers, after the true menfolk came, we do not know. For ages they may have held out, growing more cunning and dangerous as they became rare. The true men hunted them down by their spoor and by their tracks, and watched for the smoke of their fires, and made food scarce for them.\nGreat Paladins arose in that forgotten world, men who stood forth and smote the grey man-beast face to face and slew him. They made long spears of wood, hardened by fire at the tips; they raised shields of skin against his mighty blows. They struck at him with stones on cords, and slung them at him with slings. And it was not simply men who withstood the grisly beast but women. They stood over their children; they stood by their men against this eerie thing that was like and yet not like mankind. Unless the savants read all the signs awry, it was the women who were the makers of the larger tribes into which human families were already growing in those ancient times. It was the woman\u2019s subtle, love-guided wits which protected her sons from the fierce anger of the Old Man, and taught them to avoid his jealousy and wrath, and persuaded him to tolerate them and so have their help against the grisly enemy. It was woman, says Atkinson, in the beginning of things human, who taught the primary tabus, that a son must go aside out of the way of his stepmother, and get himself a wife from another tribe, so as to keep the peace within the family. She came between the fratricides, and was the first peacemaker. Human societies in their beginnings were her work, done against the greater solitariness, the lonely fierceness of the adult male. Through her, men learnt the primary co-operation of sonship and brotherhood. The grisly folk had not learnt even the rudest elements of co-operation, and mankind had already spelt out the alphabet of a unity that may some day comprehend the whole earth. The menfolk kept together by the dozen and by the score. By ones and twos and threes therefore the grisly folk were beset and slain, until there were no more of them left in the world.\nGeneration after generation, age after age, that long struggle for existence went on between these men who were not quite men and the men, our ancestors, who came out of the South into western Europe. Thousands of fights and hunts, sudden murders and headlong escapes there were amidst the caves and thickets of that chill and windy world between the last age of glaciers and our own warmer time. Until at length the last poor grisly was brought to bay and faced the spears of his pursuers in anger and despair.\nWhat leapings of the heart were there not throughout that long warfare! What moments of terror and triumph! What acts of devotion and desperate wonders of courage! And the strain of the victors was our strain; we are lineally identical with those sun-brown painted beings who ran and fought and helped one another, the blood in our veins glowed in those fights and chilled in those fears of the forgotten past. For it was forgotten. Except perhaps for some vague terrors in our dreaming life and for some lurking element of tradition in the legends and warnings of the nursery, it has gone altogether out of the memory of our race. But nothing is ever completely lost. Seventy or eighty years ago a few curious savants began to suspect that there were hidden memories in certain big chipped flints and scraps of bone they found in ancient gravels. Much more recently others have begun to find hints of remote strange experiences in the dreams and odd kinks in modern minds. By degrees these dry bones begin to live again.\nThis restoration of the past is one of the most astonishing adventures of the human mind. As humanity follows the gropings of scientific men among these ancient vestiges, it is like a man who turns over the yellow pages of some long-forgotten diary, some engagement book of his adolescence. His dead youth lives again. Once more the old excitements stir him, the old happiness returns. But the old passions that once burnt, only warm him now, and the old fears and distresses signify nothing.\nA day may come when these recovered memories may grow as vivid as if we in our own persons had been there and shared the thrill and the fear of those primordial days; a day may come when the great beasts of the past will leap to life again in our imaginations, when we shall walk again in vanished scenes, stretch painted limbs we thought were dust, and feel again the sunshine of a million years ago.\n"

                "content": "\nAll were crowding around M. Bermutier, the judge, who was giving his opinion about the Saint-Cloud mystery. For a month this inexplicable crime had been the talk of Paris. Nobody could make head or tail of it.\nM. Bermutier, standing with his back to the fireplace, was talking, citing the evidence, discussing the various theories, but arriving at no conclusion.\nSome women had risen, in order to get nearer to him, and were standing with their eyes fastened on the clean-shaven face of the judge, who was saying such weighty things. They, were shaking and trembling, moved by fear and curiosity, and by the eager and insatiable desire for the horrible, which haunts the soul of every woman. One of them, paler than the others, said during a pause:\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It verges on the supernatural. The truth will never be known.\u201d\nThe judge turned to her:\n\u201cTrue, madame, it is likely that the actual facts will never be discovered. As for the word \u2018supernatural\u2019 which you have just used, it has nothing to do with the matter. We are in the presence of a very cleverly conceived and executed crime, so well enshrouded in mystery that we cannot disentangle it from the involved circumstances which surround it. But once I had to take charge of an affair in which the uncanny seemed to play a part. In fact, the case became so confused that it had to be given up.\u201d\nSeveral women exclaimed at once:\n\u201cOh! Tell us about it!\u201d\nM. Bermutier smiled in a dignified manner, as a judge should, and went on:\n\u201cDo not think, however, that I, for one minute, ascribed anything in the case to supernatural influences. I believe only in normal causes. But if, instead of using the word \u2018supernatural\u2019 to express what we do not understand, we were simply to make use of the word \u2018inexplicable,\u2019 it would be much better. At any rate, in the affair of which I am about to tell you, it is especially the surrounding, preliminary circumstances which impressed me. Here are the facts:\n\u201cI was, at that time, a judge at Ajaccio, a little white city on the edge of a bay which is surrounded by high mountains.\n\u201cThe majority of the cases which came up before me concerned vendettas. There are some that are superb, dramatic, ferocious, heroic. We find there the most beautiful causes for revenge of which one could dream, enmities hundreds of years old, quieted for a time but never extinguished; abominable stratagems, murders becoming massacres and almost deeds of glory. For two years I heard of nothing but the price of blood, of this terrible Corsican prejudice which compels revenge for insults meted out to the offending person and all his descendants and relatives. I had seen old men, children, cousins murdered; my head was full of these stories.\n\u201cOne day I learned that an Englishman had just hired a little villa at the end of the bay for several years. He had brought with him a French servant, whom he had engaged on the way at Marseilles.\n\u201cSoon this peculiar person, living alone, only going out to hunt and fish, aroused a widespread interest. He never spoke to any one, never went to the town, and every morning he would practice for an hour or so with his revolver and rifle.\n\u201cLegends were built up around him. It was said that he was some high personage, fleeing from his fatherland for political reasons; then it was affirmed that he was in hiding after having committed some abominable crime. Some particularly horrible circumstances were even mentioned.\n\u201cIn my judicial position I thought it necessary to get some information about this man, but it was impossible to learn anything. He called himself Sir John Rowell.\n\u201cI therefore had to be satisfied with watching him as closely as I could, but I could see nothing suspicious about his actions.\n\u201cHowever, as rumors about him were growing and becoming more widespread, I decided to try to see this stranger myself, and I began to hunt regularly in the neighborhood of his grounds.\n\u201cFor a long time I watched without finding an opportunity. At last it came to me in the shape of a partridge which I shot and killed right in front of the Englishman. My dog fetched it for me, but, taking the bird, I went at once to Sir John Rowell and, begging his pardon, asked him to accept it.\n\u201cHe was a big man, with red hair and beard, very tall, very broad, a kind of calm and polite Hercules. He had nothing of the so-called British stiffness, and in a broad English accent he thanked me warmly for my attention. At the end of a month we had had five or six conversations.\n\u201cOne night, at last, as I was passing before his door, I saw him in the garden, seated astride a chair, smoking his pipe. I bowed and he invited me to come in and have a glass of beer. I needed no urging.\n\u201cHe received me with the most punctilious English courtesy, sang the praises of France and of Corsica, and declared that he was quite in love with this country.\n\u201cThen, with great caution and under the guise of a vivid interest, I asked him a few questions about his life and his plans. He answered without embarrassment, telling me that he had travelled a great deal in Africa, in the Indies, in America. He added, laughing:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018I have had many adventures.\u2019\n\u201cThen I turned the conversation on hunting, and he gave me the most curious details on hunting the hippopotamus, the tiger, the elephant and even the gorilla.\n\u201cI said:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Are all these animals dangerous?\u2019\n\u201cHe smiled:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Oh, no! Man is the worst.\u2019\n\u201cAnd he laughed a good broad laugh, the wholesome laugh of a contented Englishman.\n\u201c\u200a\u2018I have also frequently been man-hunting.\u2019\n\u201cThen he began to talk about weapons, and he invited me to come in and see different makes of guns.\n\u201cHis parlor was draped in black, black silk embroidered in gold. Big yellow flowers, as brilliant as fire, were worked on the dark material.\n\u201cHe said:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018It is a Japanese material.\u2019\n\u201cBut in the middle of the widest panel a strange thing attracted my attention. A black object stood out against a square of red velvet. I went up to it; it was a hand, a human hand. Not the clean white hand of a skeleton, but a dried black hand, with yellow nails, the muscles exposed and traces of old blood on the bones, which were cut off as clean as though it had been chopped off with an axe, near the middle of the forearm.\n\u201cAround the wrist, an enormous iron chain, riveted and soldered to this unclean member, fastened it to the wall by a ring, strong enough to hold an elephant in leash.\n\u201cI asked:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018What is that?\u2019\n\u201cThe Englishman answered quietly:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018That is my best enemy. It comes from America, too. The bones were severed by a sword and the skin cut off with a sharp stone and dried in the sun for a week.\u2019\n\u201cI touched these human remains, which must have belonged to a giant. The uncommonly long fingers were attached by enormous tendons which still had pieces of skin hanging to them in places. This hand was terrible to see; it made one think of some savage vengeance.\n\u201cI said:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018This man must have been very strong.\u2019\n\u201cThe Englishman answered quietly:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Yes, but I was stronger than he. I put on this chain to hold him.\u2019\n\u201cI thought that he was joking. I said:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018This chain is useless now, the hand won\u2019t run away.\u2019\n\u201cSir John Rowell answered seriously:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018It always wants to go away. This chain is needed.\u2019\n\u201cI glanced at him quickly, questioning his face, and I asked myself:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Is he an insane man or a practical joker?\u2019\n\u201cBut his face remained inscrutable, calm and friendly. I turned to other subjects, and admired his rifles.\n\u201cHowever, I noticed that he kept three loaded revolvers in the room, as though constantly in fear of some attack.\n\u201cI paid him several calls. Then I did not go any more. People had become used to his presence; everybody had lost interest in him.\n\u201cA whole year rolled by. One morning, toward the end of November, my servant awoke me and announced that Sir John Rowell had been murdered during the night.\n\u201cHalf an hour later I entered the Englishman\u2019s house, together with the police commissioner and the captain of the gendarmes. The servant, bewildered and in despair, was crying before the door. At first I suspected this man, but he was innocent.\n\u201cThe guilty party could never be found.\n\u201cOn entering Sir John\u2019s parlor, I noticed the body, stretched out on its back, in the middle of the room.\n\u201cHis vest was torn, the sleeve of his jacket had been pulled off, everything pointed to, a violent struggle.\n\u201cThe Englishman had been strangled! His face was black, swollen and frightful, and seemed to express a terrible fear. He held something between his teeth, and his neck, pierced by five or six holes which looked as though they had been made by some iron instrument, was covered with blood.\n\u201cA physician joined us. He examined the finger marks on the neck for a long time and then made this strange announcement:\n\u201c\u200a\u2018It looks as though he had been strangled by a skeleton.\u2019\n\u201cA cold chill seemed to run down my back, and I looked over to where I had formerly seen the terrible hand. It was no longer there. The chain was hanging down, broken.\n\u201cI bent over the dead man and, in his contracted mouth, I found one of the fingers of this vanished hand, cut\u2014or rather sawed off by the teeth down to the second knuckle.\n\u201cThen the investigation began. Nothing could be discovered. No door, window or piece of furniture had been forced. The two watch dogs had not been aroused from their sleep.\n\u201cHere, in a few words, is the testimony of the servant:\n\u201cFor a month his master had seemed excited. He had received many letters, which he would immediately burn.\n\u201cOften, in a fit of passion which approached madness, he had taken a switch and struck wildly at this dried hand riveted to the wall, and which had disappeared, no one knows how, at the very hour of the crime.\n\u201cHe would go to bed very late and carefully lock himself in. He always kept weapons within reach. Often at night he would talk loudly, as though he were quarrelling with some one.\n\u201cThat night, somehow, he had made no noise, and it was only on going to open the windows that the servant had found Sir John murdered. He suspected no one.\n\u201cI communicated what I knew of the dead man to the judges and public officials. Throughout the whole island a minute investigation was carried on. Nothing could be found out.\n\u201cOne night, about three months after the crime, I had a terrible nightmare. I seemed to see the horrible hand running over my curtains and walls like an immense scorpion or spider. Three times I awoke, three times I went to sleep again; three times I saw the hideous object galloping round my room and moving its fingers like legs.\n\u201cThe following day the hand was brought me, found in the cemetery, on the grave of Sir John Rowell, who had been buried there because we had been unable to find his family. The first finger was missing.\n\u201cLadies, there is my story. I know nothing more.\u201d\nThe women, deeply stirred, were pale and trembling. One of them exclaimed:\n\u201cBut that is neither a climax nor an explanation! We will be unable to sleep unless you give us your opinion of what had occurred.\u201d\nThe judge smiled severely:\n\u201cOh! Ladies, I shall certainly spoil your terrible dreams. I simply believe that the legitimate owner of the hand was not dead, that he came to get it with his remaining one. But I don\u2019t know how. It was a kind of vendetta.\u201d\nOne of the women murmured:\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be that.\u201d\nAnd the judge, still smiling, said:\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that my explanation would not satisfy you?\u201d\n"

                "content": "\nDown below there was only a vast white undulating sea of cloud. Above there was the sun, and the sun was white like the clouds, because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air.\nHe was still flying the Spitfire. His right hand was on the stick, and he was working the rudder bar with his left leg alone. It was quite easy. The machine was flying well, and he knew what he was doing.\nEverything is fine, he thought. I\u2019m doing all right. I\u2019m doing nicely. I know my way home. I\u2019ll be there in half an hour. When I land I shall taxi in and switch off my engine and I shall say, help me to get out, will you. I shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural and none of them will take any notice. Then I shall say, someone help me to get out. I can\u2019t do it alone because I\u2019ve lost one of my legs. They\u2019ll all laugh and think that I\u2019m joking, and I shall say, all right, come and have a look, you unbelieving bastards. Then Yorky will climb up onto the wing and look inside. He\u2019ll probably be sick because of all the blood and the mess. I shall laugh and say, for God\u2019s sake, help me out.\nHe glanced down again at his right leg. There was not much of it left. The cannon shell had taken him on the thigh, just above the knee, and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood. But there was no pain. When he looked down, he felt as though he were seeing something that did not belong to him. It had nothing to do with him. It was just a mess which happened to be there in the cockpit; something strange and unusual and rather interesting. It was like finding a dead cat on the sofa.\nHe really felt fine, and because he still felt fine, he felt excited and unafraid.\nI won\u2019t even bother to call up on the radio for the blood wagon, he thought. It isn\u2019t necessary. And when I land I\u2019ll sit there quite normally and say, some of you fellows come and help me out, will you, because I\u2019ve lost one of my legs. That will be funny. I\u2019ll laugh a little while I\u2019m saying it; I\u2019ll say it calmly and slowly, and they\u2019ll think I\u2019m joking. When Yorky comes up onto the wing and gets sick, I\u2019ll say, Yorky, you old son of a bitch, have you fixed my car yet? Then when I get out I\u2019ll make my report and later I\u2019ll go up to London. I\u2019ll take that half bottle of whisky with me and I\u2019ll give it to Bluey. We\u2019ll sit in her room and drink it. I\u2019ll get the water out of the bathroom tap. I won\u2019t say much until it\u2019s time to go to bed, then Ill say, Bluey, I\u2019ve got a surprise for you. I lost a leg today. But I don\u2019t mind so long as you don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t even hurt.\nWe\u2019ll go everywhere in cars. I always hated walking, except when I walked down the street of the coppersmiths in Bagdad, but I could go in a rickshaw. I could go home and chop wood, but the head always flies off the ax. Hot water, that\u2019s what it needs; put it in the bath and make the handle swell. I chopped lots of wood last time I went home, and I put the ax in the bath. . . .\nThen he saw the sun shining on the engine cowling of his machine. He saw the rivets in the metal, and he remembered where he was. He realized that he was no longer feeling good; that he was sick and giddy. His head kept falling forward onto his chest because his neck seemed no longer to have any strength. But he knew that he was flying the Spitfire, and he could feel the handle of the stick between the fingers of his right hand.\nI\u2019m going to pass out, he thought. Any moment now I\u2019m going to pass out.\nHe looked at his altimeter. Twenty-one thousand. To test himself he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands. Twenty-one thousand and what? As he looked the dial became blurred, and he could not even see the needle. He knew then that he must bail out; that there was not a second to lose, otherwise he would become unconscious. Quickly, frantically, he tried to slide back the hood with his left hand, but he had not the strength. For a second he took his right hand off the stick, and with both hands he managed to push the hood back. The rush of cold air on his face seemed to help. He had a moment of great clearness, and his actions became orderly and precise. That is what happens with a good pilot. He took some quick deep breaths from his oxygen mask, and as he did so, he looked out over the side of the cockpit. Down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud, and he realized that he did not know where he was.\nIt\u2019ll be the Channel, he thought. I\u2019m sure to fall in the drink.\nHe throttled back, pulled off his helmet, undid his straps, and pushed the stick hard over to the left. The Spitfire dripped its port wing, and turned smoothly over onto its back. The pilot fell out.\nAs he fell he opened his eyes, because he knew that he must not pass out before he had pulled the cord. On one side he saw the sun; on the other he saw the whiteness of the clouds, and as he fell, as he somersaulted in the air, the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds. They chased each other in a small circle; they ran faster and faster, and there was the sun and the clouds and the clouds and the sun, and the clouds came nearer until suddenly there was no longer any sun, but only a great whiteness. The whole world was white, and there was nothing in it. It was so white that sometimes it looked black, and after a time it was either white or black, but mostly it was white. He watched it as it turned from white to black, and then back to white again, and the white stayed for a long time, but the black lasted only for a few seconds. He got into the habit of going to sleep during the white periods, and of waking up just in time to see the world when it was black. But the black was very quick. Sometimes it was only a flash, like someone switching off the light, and switching it on again at once, and so whenever it was white, he dozed off.\nOne day, when it was white, he put out a hand and he touched something. He took it between his fingers and crumpled it. For a time he lay there, idly letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched. Then slowly he opened his eyes, looked down at his hand, and saw that he was holding something which was white. It was the edge of a sheet. He knew it was a sheet because he could see the texture of the material and the stitchings on the hem. He screwed up his eyes, and opened them again quickly. This time he saw the room. He saw the bed in which he was lying; he saw the grey walls and the door and the green curtains over the window. There were some roses on the table by his bed.\nThen he saw the basin on the table near the roses. It was a white enamel basin, and beside it there was a small medicine glass.\nThis is a hospital, he thought. I am in a hospital. But he could remember nothing. He lay back on his pillow, looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened. He was gazing at the smooth greyness of the ceiling which was so clean and gray, and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it. The sight of this fly, the suddenness of seeing this small black speck on a sea of gray, brushed the surface of his brain, and quickly, in that second, he remembered everything. He remembered the Spitfire and he remembered the altimeter showing twenty-one thousand feet. He remembered the pushing back of the hood with both hands, and he remembered the bailing out. He remembered his leg.\nIt seemed all right now. He looked down at the end of the bed, but he could not tell. He put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees. He found one of them, but when he felt for the other, his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages.\nJust then the door opened and a nurse came in.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve waked up at last.\u201d\nShe was not good-looking, but she was large and clean. She was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair. More than that he did not notice.\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky fellow. You landed in a wood near the beach. You\u2019re in Brighton. They brought you in two days ago, and now you\u2019re all fixed up. You look fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a leg,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. We\u2019ll get you another one. Now you must go to sleep. The doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour.\u201d She picked up the basin and the medicine glass and went out.\nBut he did not sleep. He wanted to keep his eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away. He lay looking at the ceiling. The fly was still there. It was very energetic. It would run forward very fast for a few inches, then it would stop. Then it would run forward again, stop, run forward, stop, and every now and then it would take off and buzz around viciously in small circles. It always landed back in the same place on the ceiling and started running and stopping all over again. He watched it for so long that after a while it was no longer a fly, but only a black speck upon a sea of gray, and he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door, and stood aside while the doctor came in. He was an Army doctor, a major, and he had some last war ribbons on his chest. He was bald and small, but he had a cheerful face and kind eyes.\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to wake up at last. How are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cI feel all right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff. You\u2019ll be up and about in no time.\u201d\nThe doctor took his wrist to feel his pulse.\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, \u201csome of the lads from your squadron were ringing up and asking about you. They wanted to come along and see you, but I said that they\u2019d better wait a day or two. Told them you were all right, and that they could come and see you a little later on. Just lie quiet and take it easy for a bit. Got something to read?\u201d He glanced at the table with the roses. \u201cNo. Well, nurse will look after you. She\u2019ll get you anything you want.\u201d With that he waved his hand and went out, followed by the large clean nurse.\nWhen they had gone, he lay back and looked at the ceiling again. The fly was still there and as he lay watching it he heard the noise of an airplane in the distance. He lay listening to the sound of its engines. It was a long way away. I wonder what it is, he thought. Let me see if I can place it. Suddenly he jerked his head sharply to one side. Anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a Junkers 88. They can tell most other German bombers for that matter, but especially a Junkers 88. The engines seem to sing a duet. There is a deep vibrating bass voice and with it there is a high pitched tenor. It is the singing of the tenor which makes the sound of a JU-88 something which one cannot mistake.\nHe lay listening to the noise, and he felt quite certain about what it was. But where were the sirens, and where the guns? That German pilot certainly had a nerve coming near Brighton alone in daylight.\nThe aircraft was always far away, and soon the noise faded away into the distance. Later on there was another. This one, too, was far away, but there was the same deep undulating bass and the high singing tenor, and there was no mistaking it. He had heard that noise every day during the battle.\nHe was puzzled. There was a bell on the table by the bed. He reached out his hand and rang it. He heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor, and the nurse came in.\n\u201cNurse, what were those airplanes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t hear them. Probably fighters or bombers. I expect they were returning from France. Why, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cThey were JU-88\u2019s. I\u2019m sure they were JU-88\u2019s. I know the sound of the engines. There were two of them. What were they doing over here?\u201d\nThe nurse came up to the side of his bed and began to straighten out the sheets and tuck them in under the mattress.\n\u201cGracious me, what things you imagine. You mustn\u2019t worry about a thing like that. Would you like me to get you something to read?\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\nShe patted his pillow and brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand.\n\u201cThey never come over in daylight any longer. You know that. They were probably Lancasters or Flying Fortresses.\u201d\n\u201cNurse.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cCould I have a cigarette?\u201d\n\u201cWhy certainly you can.\u201d\nShe went out and came back almost at once with a packet of Players and some matches. She handed one to him and when he had put it in his mouth, she struck a match and lit it.\n\u201cIf you want me again,\u201d she said, \u201cjust ring the bell,\u201d and she went out.\nOnce toward evening he heard the noise of another aircraft. It was far away, but even so he knew that it was a single-engined machine. But he could not place it. It was going fast; he could tell that. But it wasn\u2019t a Spit, and it wasn\u2019t a Hurricane Fighter Air Craft. It did not sound like an American engine either. They make more noise. He did not know what it was, and it worried him greatly. Perhaps I am very ill, he thought. Perhaps I am imagining things. Perhaps I am a little delirious. I simply do not know what to think.\nThat evening the nurse came in with a basin of hot water and began to wash him.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t still think that we\u2019re being bombed.\u201d\nShe had taken off his pajama top and was soaping his right arm with a flannel. He did not answer.\nShe rinsed the flannel in the water, rubbed more soap on it, and began to wash his chest.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking fine this evening,\u201d she said. \u201cThey operated on you as soon as you came in. They did a marvelous job. You\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ve got a brother in the RAF,\u201d she added. \u201cFlying bombers.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI went to school in Brighton.\u201d\nShe looked up quickly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll know some people in the town.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI know quite a few.\u201d\nShe had finished washing his chest and arms, and now she turned back the bedclothes, so that his left leg was uncovered. She did it in such a way that his bandaged stump remained under the sheets. She undid the cord of his pajama trousers and took them off. There was no trouble because they had cut off the right trouser leg, so that it could not interfere with the bandages. She began to wash his left leg and the rest of his body. This was the first time he had had a bed bath, and he was embarrassed. She laid a towel under his leg, and she was washing his foot with the flannel. She said, \u201cThis wretched soap won\u2019t lather at all. It\u2019s the water. It\u2019s as hard as nails.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cNone of the soap is very good now and, of course, with hard water it\u2019s hopeless.\u201d As he said it he remembered something. He remembered the baths which he used to take at school in Brighton, in the long stone-floored bathroom which had four baths in a room. He remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body, and he remembered how the foam used to float on the surface of the water, so that you could not see your legs underneath. He remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for the teeth.\n\u201cIn Brighton,\u201d he said, \u201cthe water isn\u2019t . . .\u201d\nHe did not finish the sentence. Something had occurred to him; something so fantastic and absurd that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about it and having a good laugh.\nShe looked up. \u201cThe water isn\u2019t what?\u201d she said.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he answered. \u201cI was dreaming.\nShe rinsed the flannel in the basin, wiped the soap off his leg, and dried him with a towel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be washed,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel better.\u201d He was feeling his face with his hands. \u201cI need a shave.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do that tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you can do it yourself then.\u201d\nThat night he could not sleep. He lay awake thinking of the Junkers 88\u2019s and of the hardness of the water. He could think of nothing else. They were JU-88\u2019s, he said to himself. I know they were. And yet it is not possible, because they would not be flying around so low over here in broad daylight. I know that it is true, and yet I know that it is impossible. Perhaps I am ill. Perhaps I am behaving like a fool and do not know what I am doing or saying. Perhaps I am delirious. For a long time he lay awake thinking these things, and once he sat up in bed and said aloud, \u201cI will prove that I am not crazy. I will make a little speech about something complicated and intellectual. I will talk about what to do with Germany after the war.\u201d But before he had time to begin, he was asleep.\nHe woke just as the first light of day was showing through the slit in the curtains over the window. The room was still dark, but he could tell that it was already beginning to get light outside. He lay looking at the grey light which was showing through the slit in the curtain, and as he lay there he remembered the day before. He remembered the Junkers 88\u2019s and the hardness of the water; he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor, and now the small grain of doubt took root in his mind and it began to grow.\nHe looked around the room. The nurse had taken the roses out the night before, and there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes, a box of matches and an ash tray. Otherwise, it was bare. It was no longer warm or friendly. It was not even comfortable. It was cold and empty and very quiet.\nSlowly the grain of doubt grew, and with it came fear, a light, dancing fear that warned but did not frighten; the kind of fear that one gets not because one is afraid, but because one feels that there is something wrong. Quickly the doubt and the fear grew so that he became restless and angry, and when he touched his forehead with his hand, he found that it was damp with sweat. He knew then that he must do something; that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong, and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains. From where he lay, that window was right in front of him, but it was fully ten yards away. Somehow he must reach it and look out. The idea became an obsession with him, and soon he could think of nothing except the window. But what about his leg? He put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the thick bandaged stump which was all that was left on the right-hand side. It seemed all right. It didn\u2019t hurt. But it would not be easy.\nHe sat up. Then he pushed the bedclothes aside and put his left leg on the floor. Slowly, carefully, he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well; and then he was out of bed, kneeling on the carpet. He looked at the stump. It was very short and thick, covered with bandages. It was beginning to hurt and he could feel it throbbing. He wanted to collapse, lie down on the carpet and do nothing, but he knew that he must go on.\nWith two arms and one leg, he crawled over towards the window. He would reach forward as far as he could with his arms, then he would give a little jump and slide his left leg along after them. Each time he did, it jarred his wound so that he gave a soft grunt of pain, but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee. When he got to the window he reached up, and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill. Slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg. Then quickly he pushed aside the curtains and looked out.\nHe saw a small house with a gray tiled roof standing alone beside a narrow lane, and immediately behind it there was a plowed field. In front of the house there was an untidy garden, and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane. He was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign. It was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole, and because the hedge had not been trimmed for a long time, the branches had grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as though it had been placed in the middle of the hedge. There was something written on the board with white paint, and he pressed his head against the glass of the window, trying to read what it said. The first letter was a G, he could see that. The second was an A, and the third was an R. One after another he managed to see what the letters were. There were three words, and slowly he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them. G-A-R-D-E A-U C-H-I-E-N. Garde au chien. That is what it said.\nHe stood there balancing on one leg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands, staring at the sign and at the whitewashed lettering of the words. For a moment he could think of nothing at all. He stood there looking at the sign, repeating the words over and over to himself, and then slowly he began to realize the full meaning of the thing. He looked up at the cottage and at the plowed field. He looked at the small orchard on the left of the cottage and he looked at the green countryside beyond. \u201cSo this is France,\u201d he said. \u201cI am France.\u201d\nNow the throbbing in his right thigh was very great. It felt as though someone was pounding the end of his stump with a hammer, and suddenly the pain became so intense that it affected his head and for a moment he thought he was going to fall. Quickly he knelt down again, crawled back to the bed and hoisted himself in. He pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow, exhausted. He could still think of nothing at all except the small sign by the hedge, and the plowed field and the orchard. It was the words on the sign that he could not forget.\nIt was some time before the nurse came in. She came carrying a basin of hot water and she said, \u201cGood morning, how are you today?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cGood morning, nurse.\u201d\nThe pain was still great under the bandages, but he did not wish to tell this woman anything. He looked at her as she busied herself with getting the washing things ready. He looked at her more carefully now. Her hair was very fair. She was tall and big-boned, and her face seemed pleasant. But there was something a little uneasy about her eyes. They were never still. They never looked at anything for more than a moment and they moved too quickly from one place to another in the room. There was something about her movements also. They were too sharp and nervous to go well with the casual manner in which she spoke.\nShe set down the basin, took off his pajama top and began to wash him.\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. She was washing his arms and his chest.\n\u201cI believe there\u2019s someone coming down to see you from the Air Ministry after breakfast,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey want a report or something. I expect you know all about it. How you got shot down and all that. I won\u2019t let him stay long, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nHe did not answer. She finished washing him, and gave him a toothbrush and some tooth powder. He brushed his teeth, rinsed his mouth and spat the water out into the basin.\nLater she brought him his breakfast on a tray, but he did not want to eat. He was still feeling weak and sick, and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened. And there was a sentence running through his head. It was a sentence which Johnny, the Intelligence Officer of his squadron, always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out. He could see Johnny now, leaning against the wall of the dispersal hut with his pipe in his hand, saying, \u201cAnd if they get you, don\u2019t forget, just your name, rank and number. Nothing else. For God\u2019s sake, say nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d she said as she put the tray on his lap. \u201cI\u2019ve got you an egg. Can you manage all right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe stood beside the bed. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood. If you want another egg I might be able to get you one.\u201d\n\u201cThis is all right.\u201d\n\u201cWell, just ring the bell if you want any more.\u201d And she went out.\nHe had just finished eating, when the nurse came in again.\nShe said, \u201cWing Commander Roberts is here. I\u2019ve told him that he can only stay for a few minutes.\u201d\nShe beckoned with her hand and the Wing Commander came in.\n\u201cSorry to bother you like this,\u201d he said.\nHe was an ordinary RAF officer, dressed in a uniform which was a little shabby, and he wore wings and a DFC. He was fairly tall and thin with plenty of black hair. His teeth, which were irregular and widely spaced, stuck out a little even when he closed his mouth. As he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket, and he pulled up a chair and sat down.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\nThere was no answer.\n\u201cTough luck about your leg. I know how you feel. I hear you put up a fine show before they got you.\u201d\nThe man in the bed was lying quite still, watching the man in the chair.\nThe man in the chair said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get this stuff over. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to answer a few questions so that I can fill in this combat report. Let me see now, first of all, what was your squadron?\u201d\nThe man in the bed did not move. He looked straight at the Wing Commander and he said, \u201cMy name is Peter Williamson. My rank is Squadron Leader and my number is nine seven two four five seven.\u201d\n"

It is forbidden to go to any of the Dead Places except to search for metal and then he who touches the metal must be a priest or the son of a priest. Afterwards, both the man and the metal must be purified. These are the rules and the laws; they are well made. It is forbidden to cross the great river and look upon the place that was the Place of the Gods\u2014this is most strictly forbidden. We do not even say its name though we know its name. It is there that spirits live, and demons\u2014it is there that there are the ashes of the Great Burning. These things are forbidden\u2014they have been forbidden since the beginning of time.\nMy father is a priest; I am the son of a priest. I have been in the Dead Places near us, with my father\u2014at first, I was afraid. When my father went into the house to search for the metal, I stood by the door and my heart felt small and weak. It was a dead man\u2019s house, a spirit house. It did not have the smell of man, though there were old bones in a corner. But it is not fitting that a priest\u2019s son should show fear. I looked at the bones in the shadow and kept my voice still.\nThen my father came out with the metal\u2014a good, strong piece. He looked at me with both eyes but I had not run away. He gave me the metal to hold\u2014I took it and did not die. So he knew that I was truly his son and would be a priest in my time. That was when I was very young\u2014nevertheless, my brothers would not have done it, though they are good hunters. After that, they gave me the good piece of meat and the warm corner by the fire. My father watched over me\u2014he was glad that I should be a priest. But when I boasted or wept without a reason, he punished me more strictly than my brothers. That was right.\nAfter a time, I myself was allowed to go into the dead houses and search for metal. So I learned the ways of those houses\u2014and if I saw bones, I was no longer afraid. The bones are light and old\u2014sometimes they will fall into dust if you touch them. But that is a great sin.\nI was taught the chants and the spells\u2014I was taught how to stop the running of blood from a wound and many secrets. A priest must know many secrets\u2014that was what my father said. If the hunters think we do all things by chants and spells, they may believe so\u2014it does not hurt them. I was taught how to read in the old books and how to make the old writings\u2014that was hard and took a long time. My knowledge made me happy\u2014it was like a fire in my heart. Most of all, I liked to hear of the Old Days and the stories of the gods. I asked myself many questions that I could not answer, but it was good to ask them. At night, I would lie awake and listen to the wind\u2014it seemed to me that it was the voice of the gods as they flew through the air.\nWe are not ignorant like the Forest People\u2014our women spin wool on the wheel, our priests wear a white robe. We do not eat grubs from the tree, we have not forgotten the old writings, although they are hard to understand. Nevertheless, my knowledge and my lack of knowledge burned in me\u2014I wished to know more. When I was a man at last, I came to my father and said, \u201cIt is time for me to go on my journey. Give me your leave.\u201d\nHe looked at me for a long time, stroking his beard, then he said at last, \u201cYes. It is time.\u201d That night, in the house of the priesthood, I asked for and received purification. My body hurt but my spirit was a cool stone. It was my father himself who questioned me about my dreams.\nHe bade me look into the smoke of the fire and see\u2014I saw and told what I saw. It was what I have always seen\u2014a river, and, beyond it, a great Dead Place and in it the gods walking. I have always thought about that. His eyes were stern when I told him\u2014he was no longer my father but a priest. He said, \u201cThis is a strong dream.\u201d\n\u201cIt is mine,\u201d I said, while the smoke waved and my head felt light. They were singing the Star song in the outer chamber and it was like the buzzing of bees in my head.\nHe asked me how the gods were dressed and I told him how they were dressed. We know how they were dressed from the book, but I saw them as if they were before me. When I had finished, he threw the sticks three times and studied them as they fell.\n\u201cThis is a very strong dream,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may eat you up.\u201d\n\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d I said and looked at him with both eyes. My voice sounded thin in my ears but that was because of the smoke.\nHe touched me on the breast and the forehead. He gave me the bow and the three arrows.\n\u201cTake them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is forbidden to travel east. It is forbidden to cross the river. It is forbidden to go to the Place of the Gods. All these things are forbidden.\u201d\n\u201cAll these things are forbidden,\u201d I said, but it was my voice that spoke and not my spirit. He looked at me again.\n\u201cMy son,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I had young dreams. If your dreams do not eat you up, you may be a great priest. If they eat you, you are still my son. Now go on your journey.\u201d\nI went fasting, as is the law. My body hurt but not my heart. When the dawn came, I was out of sight of the village. I prayed and purified myself, waiting for a sign. The sign was an eagle. It flew east.\nSometimes signs are sent by bad spirits. I waited again on the flat rock, fasting, taking no food. I was very still\u2014I could feel the sky above me and the earth beneath. I waited till the sun was beginning to sink. Then three deer passed in the valley, going east\u2014they did not wind me or see me. There was a white fawn with them\u2014a very great sign.\nI followed them, at a distance, waiting for what would happen. My heart was troubled about going east, yet I knew that I must go. My head hummed with my fasting\u2014I did not even see the panther spring upon the white fawn. But, before I knew it, the bow was in my hand. I shouted and the panther lifted his head from the fawn. It is not easy to kill a panther with one arrow but the arrow went through his eye and into his brain. He died as he tried to spring\u2014he rolled over, tearing at the ground. Then I knew I was meant to go east\u2014I knew that was my journey. When the night came, I made my fire and roasted meat.\nIt is eight suns journey to the east and a man passes by many Dead Places. The Forest People are afraid of them but I am not. Once I made my fire on the edge of a Dead Place at night and, next morning, in the dead house, I found a good knife, little rusted. That was small to what came afterward but it made my heart feel big. Always when I looked for game, it was in front of my arrow, and twice I passed hunting parties of the Forest People without their knowing. So I knew my magic was strong and my journey clean, in spite of the law.\nToward the setting of the eighth sun, I came to the banks of the great river. It was half-a-day\u2019s journey after I had left the god-road\u2014we do not use the god-roads now for they are falling apart into great blocks of stone, and the forest is safer going. A long way off, I had seen the water through trees but the trees were thick. At last, I came out upon an open place at the top of a cliff. There was the great river below, like a giant in the sun. It is very long, very wide. It could eat all the streams we know and still be thirsty. Its name is Ou-dis-sun, the Sacred, the Long. No man of my tribe had seen it, not even my father, the priest. It was magic and I prayed.\nThen I raised my eyes and looked south. It was there, the Place of the Gods.\nHow can I tell what it was like\u2014you do not know. It was there, in the red light, and they were too big to be houses. It was there with the red light upon it, mighty and ruined. I knew that in another moment the gods would see me. I covered my eyes with my hands and crept back into the forest.\nSurely, that was enough to do, and live. Surely it was enough to spend the night upon the cliff. The Forest People themselves do not come near. Yet, all through the night, I knew that I should have to cross the river and walk in the places of the gods, although the gods ate me up. My magic did not help me at all and yet there was a fire in my bowels, a fire in my mind. When the sun rose, I thought, \u201cMy journey has been clean. Now I will go home from my journey.\u201d But, even as I thought so, I knew I could not. If I went to the place of the gods, I would surely die, but, if I did not go, I could never be at peace with my spirit again. It is better to lose one\u2019s life than one\u2019s spirit, if one is a priest and the son of a priest.\nNevertheless, as I made the raft, the tears ran out of my eyes. The Forest People could have killed me without fight, if they had come upon me then, but they did not come. When the raft was made, I said the sayings for the dead and painted myself for death. My heart was cold as a frog and my knees like water, but the burning in my mind would not let me have peace. As I pushed the raft from the shore, I began my death song\u2014I had the right. It was a fine song.\n \n\u201cI am John, son of John,\u201d I sang. \u201cMy people are the Hill People. They are the men.\nI go into the Dead Places but I am not slain.\nI take the metal from the Dead Places but I am not blasted.\nI travel upon the god-roads and am not afraid. E-yah! I have killed the panther, I have killed the fawn!\nE-yah! I have come to the great river. No man has come there before.\nIt is forbidden to go east, but I have gone, forbidden to go on the great river, but I am there.\nOpen your hearts, you spirits, and hear my song.\nNow I go to the place of the gods, I shall not return.\nMy body is painted for death and my limbs weak, but my heart is big as I go to the place of the gods!\u201d\n \nAll the same, when I came to the Place of the Gods, I was afraid, afraid. The current of the great river is very strong\u2014it gripped my raft with its hands. That was magic, for the river itself is wide and calm. I could feel evil spirits about me, in the bright morning; I could feel their breath on my neck as I was swept down the stream. Never have I been so much alone\u2014I tried to think of my knowledge, but it was a squirrel\u2019s heap of winter nuts. There was no strength in my knowledge any more and I felt small and naked as a new-hatched bird\u2014alone upon the great river, the servant of the gods.\nYet, after a while, my eyes were opened and I saw. I saw both banks of the river\u2014I saw that once there had been god-roads across it, though now they were broken and fallen like broken vines. Very great they were, and wonderful and broken\u2014broken in the time of the Great Burning when the fire fell out of the sky. And always the current took me nearer to the Place of the Gods, and the huge ruins rose before my eyes.\nI do not know the customs of rivers\u2014we are the People of the Hills. I tried to guide my raft with the pole but it spun around. I thought the river meant to take me past the Place of the Gods and out into the Bitter Water of the legends. I grew angry then\u2014my heart felt strong. I said aloud, \u201cI am a priest and the son of a priest!\u201d The gods heard me\u2014they showed me how to paddle with the pole on one side of the raft. The current changed itself\u2014I drew near to the Place of the Gods.\nWhen I was very near, my raft struck and turned over. I can swim in our lakes\u2014I swam to the shore. There was a great spike of rusted metal sticking out into the river\u2014I hauled myself up upon it and sat there, panting. I had saved my bow and two arrows and the knife I found in the Dead Place but that was all. My raft went whirling downstream toward the Bitter Water. I looked after it, and thought if it had trod me under, at least I would be safely dead. Nevertheless, when I had dried my bow-string and re-strung it, I walked forward to the Place of the Gods.\nIt felt like ground underfoot; it did not burn me. It is not true what some of the tales say, that the ground there burns forever, for I have been there. Here and there were the marks and stains of the Great Burning, on the ruins, that is true. But they were old marks and old stains. It is not true either, what some of our priests say, that it is an island covered with fogs and enchantments. It is not. It is a great Dead Place\u2014greater than any Dead Place we know. Everywhere in it there are god-roads, though most are cracked and broken. Everywhere there are the ruins of the high towers of the gods.\nHow shall I tell what I saw? I went carefully, my strung bow in my hand, my skin ready for danger. There should have been the wailings of spirits and the shrieks of demons, but there were not. It was very silent and sunny where I had landed\u2014the wind and the rain and the birds that drop seeds had done their work\u2014the grass grew in the cracks of the broken stone. It is a fair island\u2014no wonder the gods built there. If I had come there, a god, I also would have built.\nHow shall I tell what I saw? The towers are not all broken\u2014here and there one still stands, like a great tree in a forest, and the birds nest high. But the towers themselves look blind, for the gods are gone. I saw a fish-hawk, catching fish in the river. I saw a little dance of white butterflies over a great heap of broken stones and columns. I went there and looked about me\u2014there was a carved stone with cut-letters, broken in half. I can read letters but I could not understand these. They said UBTREAS. There was also the shattered image of a man or a god. It had been made of white stone and he wore his hair tied back like a woman\u2019s. His name was ASHING, as I read on the cracked half of a stone. I thought it wise to pray to ASHING, though I do not know that god.\nHow shall I tell what I saw? There was no smell of man left, on stone or metal. Nor were there many trees in that wilderness of stone. There are many pigeons, nesting and dropping in the towers\u2014the gods must have loved them, or, perhaps, they used them for sacrifices. There are wild cats that roam the god-roads, green-eyed, unafraid of man. At night they wail like demons but they are not demons. The wild dogs are more dangerous, for they hunt in a pack, but them I did not meet till later. Everywhere there are the carved stones, carved with magical numbers or words.\nI went North\u2014I did not try to hide myself. When a god or a demon saw me, then I would die, but meanwhile I was no longer afraid. My hunger for knowledge burned in me\u2014there was so much that I could not understand. After awhile, I knew that my belly was hungry. I could have hunted for my meat, but I did not hunt. It is known that the gods did not hunt as we do\u2014they got their food from enchanted boxes and jars. Sometimes these are still found in the Dead Places\u2014once, when I was a child and foolish, I opened such a jar and tasted it and found the food sweet. But my father found out and punished me for it strictly, for, often, that food is death. Now, though, I had long gone past what was forbidden, and I entered the likeliest towers, looking for the food of the gods.\nI found it at last in the ruins of a great temple in the mid-city. A mighty temple it must have been, for the roof was painted like the sky at night with its stars\u2014that much I could see, though the colors were faint and dim. It went down into great caves and tunnels\u2014perhaps they kept their slaves there. But when I started to climb down, I heard the squeaking of rats, so I did not go\u2014rats are unclean, and there must have been many tribes of them, from the squeaking. But near there, I found food, in the heart of a ruin, behind a door that still opened. I ate only the fruits from the jars\u2014they had a very sweet taste. There was drink, too, in bottles of glass\u2014the drink of the gods was strong and made my head swim. After I had eaten and drunk, I slept on the top of a stone, my bow at my side.\nWhen I woke, the sun was low. Looking down from where I lay, I saw a dog sitting on his haunches. His tongue was hanging out of his mouth; he looked as if he were laughing. He was a big dog, with a grey-brown coat, as big as a wolf. I sprang up and shouted at him but he did not move\u2014he just sat there as if he were laughing. I did not like that. When I reached for a stone to throw, he moved swiftly out of the way of the stone. He was not afraid of me; he looked at me as if I were meat. No doubt I could have killed him with an arrow, but I did not know if there were others. Moreover, night was falling.\nI looked about me\u2014not far away there was a great, broken god-road, leading North. The towers were high enough, but not so high, and while many of the dead-houses were wrecked, there were some that stood. I went toward this god-road, keeping to the heights of the ruins, while the dog followed. When I had reached the god-road, I saw that there were others behind him. If I had slept later, they would have come upon me asleep and torn out my throat. As it was, they were sure enough of me; they did not hurry. When I went into the dead-house, they kept watch at the entrance\u2014doubtless they thought they would have a fine hunt. But a dog cannot open a door and I knew, from the books, that the gods did not like to live on the ground but on high.\nI had just found a door I could open when the dogs decided to rush. Ha! They were surprised when I shut the door in their faces\u2014it was a good door, of strong metal. I could hear their foolish baying beyond it but I did not stop to answer them. I was in darkness\u2014I found stairs and climbed. There were many stairs, turning around till my head was dizzy. At the top was another door\u2014I found the knob and opened it. I was in a long small chamber\u2014on one side of it was a bronze door that could not be opened, for it had no handle. Perhaps there was a magic word to open it but I did not have the word. I turned to the door in the opposite side of the wall. The lock of it was broken and I opened it and went in.\nWithin, there was a place of great riches. The god who lived there must have been a powerful god. The first room was a small ante-room\u2014I waited there for some time, telling the spirits of the place that I came in peace and not as a robber. When it seemed to me that they had had time to hear me, I went on. Ah, what riches! Few, even, of the windows had been broken\u2014it was all as it had been. The great windows that looked over the city had not been broken at all though they were dusty and streaked with many years. There were coverings on the floors, the colors not greatly faded, and the chairs were soft and deep. There were pictures upon the walls, very strange, very wonderful\u2014I remember one of a bunch of flowers in a jar\u2014if you came close to it, you could see nothing but bits of color, but if you stood away from it, the flowers might have been picked yesterday. It made my heart feel strange to look at this picture\u2014and to look at the figure of a bird, in some hard clay, on a table and see it so like our birds. Everywhere there were books and writings, many in tongues that I could not read. The god who lived there must have been a wise god and full of knowledge. I felt I had right there, as I sought knowledge also.\nNevertheless, it was strange. There was a washing-place but no water\u2014perhaps the gods washed in air. There was a cooking-place but no wood, and though there was a machine to cook food, there was no place to put fire in it. Nor were there candles or lamps\u2014there were things that looked like lamps but they had neither oil nor wick. All these things were magic, but I touched them and lived\u2014the magic had gone out of them. Let me tell one thing to show. In the washing-place, a thing said \u201cHot\u201d but it was not hot to the touch\u2014another thing said \u201cCold\u201d but it was not cold. This must have been a strong magic but the magic was gone. I do not understand\u2014they had ways\u2014I wish that I knew.\nIt was close and dry and dusty in their house of the gods. I have said the magic was gone but that is not true\u2014it had gone from the magic things but it had not gone from the place. I felt the spirits about me, weighing upon me. Nor had I ever slept in a Dead Place before\u2014and yet, tonight, I must sleep there. When I thought of it, my tongue felt dry in my throat, in spite of my wish for knowledge. Almost I would have gone down again and faced the dogs, but I did not.\nI had not gone through all the rooms when the darkness fell. When it fell, I went back to the big room looking over the city and made fire. There was a place to make fire and a box with wood in it, though I do not think they cooked there. I wrapped myself in a floor-covering and slept in front of the fire\u2014I was very tired.\nNow I tell what is very strong magic. I woke in the midst of the night. When I woke, the fire had gone out and I was cold. It seemed to me that all around me there were whisperings and voices. I closed my eyes to shut them out. Some will say that I slept again, but I do not think that I slept. I could feel the spirits drawing my spirit out of my body as a fish is drawn on a line.\nWhy should I lie about it? I am a priest and the son of a priest. If there are spirits, as they say, in the small Dead Places near us, what spirits must there not be in that great Place of the Gods? And would not they wish to speak? After such long years? I know that I felt myself drawn as a fish is drawn on a line. I had stepped out of my body\u2014I could see my body asleep in front of the cold fire, but it was not I. I was drawn to look out upon the city of the gods.\nIt should have been dark, for it was night, but it was not dark. Everywhere there were lights\u2014lines of light\u2014circles and blurs of light\u2014ten thousand torches would not have been the same. The sky itself was alight\u2014you could barely see the stars for the glow in the sky. I thought to myself \u201cThis is strong magic\u201d and trembled. There was a roaring in my ears like the rushing of rivers. Then my eyes grew used to the light and my ears to the sound. I knew that I was seeing the city as it had been when the gods were alive.\nThat was a sight indeed\u2014yes, that was a sight: I could not have seen it in the body\u2014my body would have died. Everywhere went the gods, on foot and in chariots\u2014there were gods beyond number and counting and their chariots blocked the streets. They had turned night to day for their pleasure\u2014they did not sleep with the sun. The noise of their coming and going was the noise of many waters. It was magic what they could do\u2014it was magic what they did.\nI looked out of another window\u2014the great vines of their bridges were mended and the god-roads went East and West. Restless, restless, were the gods and always in motion! They burrowed tunnels under rivers\u2014they flew in the air. With unbelievable tools they did giant works\u2014no part of the earth was safe from them, for, if they wished for a thing, they summoned it from the other side of the world. And always, as they labored and rested, as they feasted and made love, there was a drum in their ears\u2014the pulse of the giant city, beating and beating like a man\u2019s heart.\nWere they happy? What is happiness to the gods? They were great, they were mighty, they were wonderful and terrible. As I looked upon them and their magic, I felt like a child\u2014but a little more, it seemed to me, and they would pull down the moon from the sky. I saw them with wisdom beyond wisdom and knowledge beyond knowledge. And yet not all they did was well done\u2014even I could see that\u2014and yet their wisdom could not but grow until all was peace.\nThen I saw their fate come upon them and that was terrible past speech. It came upon them as they walked the streets of their city. I have been in the fights with the Forest People\u2014I have seen men die. But this was not like that. When gods war with gods, they use weapons we do not know. It was fire falling out of the sky and a mist that poisoned. It was the time of the Great Burning and the Destruction. They ran about like ants in the streets of their city\u2014poor gods, poor gods! Then the towers began to fall. A few escaped\u2014yes, a few. The legends tell it. But, even after the city had become a Dead Place, for many years the poison was still in the ground. I saw it happen, I saw the last of them die. It was darkness over the broken city and I wept.\nAll this, I saw. I saw it as I have told it, though not in the body. When I woke in the morning, I was hungry, but I did not think first of my hunger for my heart was perplexed and confused. I knew the reason for the Dead Places but I did not see why it had happened. It seemed to me it should not have happened, with all the magic they had. I went through the house looking for an answer. There was so much in the house I could not understand\u2014and yet I am a priest and the son of a priest. It was like being on one side of the great river, at night, with no light to show the way.\nThen I saw the dead god. He was sitting in his chair, by the window, in a room I had not entered before and, for the first moment, I thought that he was alive. Then I saw the skin on the back of his hand\u2014it was like dry leather. The room was shut, hot and dry\u2014no doubt that had kept him as he was. At first I was afraid to approach him\u2014then the fear left me. He was sitting looking out over the city\u2014he was dressed in the clothes of the gods. His age was neither young nor old\u2014I could not tell his age. But there was wisdom in his face and great sadness. You could see that he would have not run away. He had sat at his window, watching his city die\u2014then he himself had died. But it is better to lose one\u2019s life than one\u2019s spirit\u2014and you could see from the face that his spirit had not been lost. I knew, that, if I touched him, he would fall into dust\u2014and yet, there was something unconquered in the face.\nThat is all of my story, for then I knew he was a man\u2014I knew then that they had been men, neither gods nor demons. It is a great knowledge, hard to tell and believe. They were men\u2014they went a dark road, but they were men. I had no fear after that\u2014I had no fear going home, though twice I fought off the dogs and once I was hunted for two days by the Forest People. When I saw my father again, I prayed and was purified. He touched my lips and my breast, he said, \u201cYou went away a boy. You come back a man and a priest.\u201d I said, \u201cFather, they were men! I have been in the Place of the Gods and seen it! Now slay me, if it is the law\u2014but still I know they were men.\u201d\nHe looked at me out of both eyes. He said, \u201cThe law is not always the same shape\u2014you have done what you have done. I could not have done it my time, but you come after me. Tell!\u201d\nI told and he listened. After that, I wished to tell all the people but he showed me otherwise. He said, \u201cTruth is a hard deer to hunt. If you eat too much truth at once, you may die of the truth. It was not idly that our fathers forbade the Dead Places.\u201d He was right\u2014it is better the truth should come little by little. I have learned that, being a priest. Perhaps, in the old days, they ate knowledge too fast.\nNevertheless, we make a beginning. It is not for the metal alone we go to the Dead Places now\u2014there are the books and the writings. They are hard to learn. And the magic tools are broken\u2014but we can look at them and wonder. At least, we make a beginning. And, when I am chief priest we shall go beyond the great river. We shall go to the Place of the Gods\u2014the place new-york\u2014not one man but a company. We shall look for the images of the gods and find the god ASHING and the others\u2014the gods Licoln and Biltmore and Moses. But they were men who built the city, not gods or demons. They were men. I remember the dead man\u2019s face. They were men who were here before us. We must build again.\n"

                "content": "\nIt is hard luck on a young fellow to have expensive tastes, great expectations, aristocratic connections, but no actual money in his pocket, and no profession by which he may earn any. The fact was that my father, a good, sanguine, easy-going man, had such confidence in the wealth and benevolence of his bachelor elder brother, Lord Southerton, that he took it for granted that I, his only son, would never be called upon to earn a living for myself. He imagined that if there were not a vacancy for me on the great Southerton Estates, at least there would be found some post in that diplomatic service which still remains the special preserve of our privileged classes. He died too early to realize how false his calculations had been. Neither my uncle nor the State took the slightest notice of me, or showed any interest in my career. An occasional brace of pheasants, or basket of hares, was all that ever reached me to remind me that I was heir to Otwell House and one of the richest estates in the country. In the meantime, I found myself a bachelor and man about town, living in a suite of apartments in Grosvenor Mansions, with no occupation save that of pigeon-shooting and polo-playing at Hurlingham. Month by month I realized that it was more and more difficult to get the brokers to renew my bills, or to cash any further post-obits upon an unentailed property. Ruin lay right across my path, and every day I saw it clearer, nearer, and more absolutely unavoidable.\nWhat made me feel my own poverty the more was that, apart from the great wealth of Lord Southerton, all my other relations were fairly well-to-do. The nearest of these was Everard King, my father\u2019s nephew and my own first cousin, who had spent an adventurous life in Brazil, and had now returned to this country to settle down on his fortune. We never knew how he made his money, but he appeared to have plenty of it, for he bought the estate of Greylands, near Clipton-on-the-Marsh, in Suffolk. For the first year of his residence in England he took no more notice of me than my miserly uncle; but at last one summer morning, to my very great relief and joy, I received a letter asking me to come down that very day and spend a short visit at Greylands Court. I was expecting a rather long visit to Bankruptcy Court at the time, and this interruption seemed almost providential. If I could only get on terms with this unknown relative of mine, I might pull through yet. For the family credit he could not let me go entirely to the wall. I ordered my valet to pack my valise, and I set off the same evening for Clipton-on-the-Marsh.\nAfter changing at Ipswich, a little local train deposited me at a small, deserted station lying amidst a rolling grassy country, with a sluggish and winding river curving in and out amidst the valleys, between high, silted banks, which showed that we were within reach of the tide. No carriage was awaiting me (I found afterwards that my telegram had been delayed), so I hired a dogcart at the local inn. The driver, an excellent fellow, was full of my relative\u2019s praises, and I learned from him that Mr. Everard King was already a name to conjure with in that part of the county. He had entertained the school-children, he had thrown his grounds open to visitors, he had subscribed to charities\u2014in short, his benevolence had been so universal that my driver could only account for it on the supposition that he had parliamentary ambitions.\nMy attention was drawn away from my driver\u2019s panegyric by the appearance of a very beautiful bird which settled on a telegraph-post beside the road. At first I thought that it was a jay, but it was larger, with a brighter plumage. The driver accounted for its presence at once by saying that it belonged to the very man whom we were about to visit. It seems that the acclimatization of foreign creatures was one of his hobbies, and that he had brought with him from Brazil a number of birds and beasts which he was endeavouring to rear in England. When once we had passed the gates of Greylands Park we had ample evidence of this taste of his. Some small spotted deer, a curious wild pig known, I believe, as a peccary, a gorgeously feathered oriole, some sort of armadillo, and a singular lumbering in-toed beast like a very fat badger, were among the creatures which I observed as we drove along the winding avenue.\nMr. Everard King, my unknown cousin, was standing in person upon the steps of his house, for he had seen us in the distance, and guessed that it was I. His appearance was very homely and benevolent, short and stout, forty-five years old, perhaps, with a round, good-humoured face, burned brown with the tropical sun, and shot with a thousand wrinkles. He wore white linen clothes, in true planter style, with a cigar between his lips, and a large Panama hat upon the back of his head. It was such a figure as one associates with a verandahed bungalow, and it looked curiously out of place in front of this broad, stone English mansion, with its solid wings and its Palladio pillars before the doorway.\n\u201cMy dear!\u201d he cried, glancing over his shoulder; \u201cmy dear, here is our guest! Welcome, welcome to Greylands! I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Cousin Marshall, and I take it as a great compliment that you should honour this sleepy little country place with your presence.\u201d\nNothing could be more hearty than his manner, and he set me at my ease in an instant. But it needed all his cordiality to atone for the frigidity and even rudeness of his wife, a tall, haggard woman, who came forward at his summons. She was, I believe, of Brazilian extraction, though she spoke excellent English, and I excused her manners on the score of her ignorance of our customs. She did not attempt to conceal, however, either then or afterwards, that I was no very welcome visitor at Greylands Court. Her actual words were, as a rule, courteous, but she was the possessor of a pair of particularly expressive dark eyes, and I read in them very clearly from the first that she heartily wished me back in London once more.\nHowever, my debts were too pressing and my designs upon my wealthy relative were too vital for me to allow them to be upset by the ill-temper of his wife, so I disregarded her coldness and reciprocated the extreme cordiality of his welcome. No pains had been spared by him to make me comfortable. My room was a charming one. He implored me to tell him anything which could add to my happiness. It was on the tip of my tongue to inform him that a blank cheque would materially help towards that end, but I felt that it might be premature in the present state of our acquaintance. The dinner was excellent, and as we sat together afterwards over his Havanas and coffee, which later he told me was specially prepared upon his own plantation, it seemed to me that all my driver\u2019s eulogies were justified, and that I had never met a more large-hearted and hospitable man.\nBut, in spite of his cheery good nature, he was a man with a strong will and a fiery temper of his own. Of this I had an example upon the following morning. The curious aversion which Mrs. Everard King had conceived towards me was so strong, that her manner at breakfast was almost offensive. But her meaning became unmistakable when her husband had quitted the room.\n\u201cThe best train in the day is at twelve-fifteen,\u201d said she.\n\u201cBut I was not thinking of going today,\u201d I answered, frankly\u2014perhaps even defiantly, for I was determined not to be driven out by this woman.\n\u201cOh, if it rests with you\u2014\u201d said she, and stopped with a most insolent expression in her eyes.\n\u201cI am sure,\u201d I answered, \u201cthat Mr. Everard King would tell me if I were outstaying my welcome.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s this?\u201d said a voice, and there he was in the room. He had overheard my last words, and a glance at our faces had told him the rest. In an instant his chubby, cheery face set into an expression of absolute ferocity.\n\u201cMight I trouble you to walk outside, Marshall?\u201d said he. (I may mention that my own name is Marshall King.)\nHe closed the door behind me, and then, for an instant, I heard him talking in a low voice of concentrated passion to his wife. This gross breach of hospitality had evidently hit upon his tenderest point. I am no eavesdropper, so I walked out on to the lawn. Presently I heard a hurried step behind me, and there was the lady, her face pale with excitement, and her eyes red with tears.\n\u201cMy husband has asked me to apologize to you, Mr. Marshall King,\u201d said she, standing with downcast eyes before me.\n\u201cPlease do not say another word, Mrs. King.\u201d\nHer dark eyes suddenly blazed out at me.\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d she hissed, with frantic vehemence, and turning on her heel swept back to the house.\nThe insult was so outrageous, so insufferable, that I could only stand staring after her in bewilderment. I was still there when my host joined me. He was his cheery, chubby self once more.\n\u201cI hope that my wife has apologized for her foolish remarks,\u201d said he.\n\u201cOh, yes\u2014yes, certainly!\u201d\nHe put his hand through my arm and walked with me up and down the lawn.\n\u201cYou must not take it seriously,\u201d said he. \u201cIt would grieve me inexpressibly if you curtailed your visit by one hour. The fact is\u2014there is no reason why there should be any concealment between relatives\u2014that my poor dear wife is incredibly jealous. She hates that anyone\u2014male or female\u2014should for an instant come between us. Her ideal is a desert island and an eternal tete-a-tete. That gives you the clue to her actions, which are, I confess, upon this particular point, not very far removed from mania. Tell me that you will think no more of it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no; certainly not.\u201d\n\u201cThen light this cigar and come round with me and see my little menagerie.\u201d\nThe whole afternoon was occupied by this inspection, which included all the birds, beasts, and even reptiles which he had imported. Some were free, some in cages, a few actually in the house. He spoke with enthusiasm of his successes and his failures, his births and his deaths, and he would cry out in his delight, like a schoolboy, when, as we walked, some gaudy bird would flutter up from the grass, or some curious beast slink into the cover. Finally he led me down a corridor which extended from one wing of the house. At the end of this there was a heavy door with a sliding shutter in it, and beside it there projected from the wall an iron handle attached to a wheel and a drum. A line of stout bars extended across the passage.\n\u201cI am about to show you the jewel of my collection,\u201d said he. \u201cThere is only one other specimen in Europe, now that the Rotterdam cub is dead. It is a Brazilian cat.\u201d\n\u201cBut how does that differ from any other cat?\u201d\n\u201cYou will soon see that,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cWill you kindly draw that shutter and look through?\u201d\nI did so, and found that I was gazing into a large, empty room, with stone flags, and small, barred windows upon the farther wall. In the centre of this room, lying in the middle of a golden patch of sunlight, there was stretched a huge creature, as large as a tiger, but as black and sleek as ebony. It was simply a very enormous and very well-kept black cat, and it cuddled up and basked in that yellow pool of light exactly as a cat would do. It was so graceful, so sinewy, and so gently and smoothly diabolical, that I could not take my eyes from the opening.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he splendid?\u201d said my host, enthusiastically.\n\u201cGlorious! I never saw such a noble creature.\u201d\n\u201cSome people call it a black puma, but really it is not a puma at all. That fellow is nearly eleven feet from tail to tip. Four years ago he was a little ball of black fluff, with two yellow eyes staring out of it. He was sold me as a new-born cub up in the wild country at the head-waters of the Rio Negro. They speared his mother to death after she had killed a dozen of them.\u201d\n\u201cThey are ferocious, then?\u201d\n\u201cThe most absolutely treacherous and bloodthirsty creatures upon earth. You talk about a Brazilian cat to an up-country Indian, and see him get the jumps. They prefer humans to game. This fellow has never tasted living blood yet, but when he does he will be a terror. At present he won\u2019t stand anyone but me in his den. Even Baldwin, the groom, dare not go near him. As to me, I am his mother and father in one.\u201d\nAs he spoke he suddenly, to my astonishment, opened the door and slipped in, closing it instantly behind him. At the sound of his voice the huge, lithe creature rose, yawned and rubbed its round, black head affectionately against his side, while he patted and fondled it.\n\u201cNow, Tommy, into your cage!\u201d said he.\nThe monstrous cat walked over to one side of the room and coiled itself up under a grating. Everard King came out, and taking the iron handle which I have mentioned, he began to turn it. As he did so the line of bars in the corridor began to pass through a slot in the wall and closed up the front of this grating, so as to make an effective cage. When it was in position he opened the door once more and invited me into the room, which was heavy with the pungent, musty smell peculiar to the great carnivora.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we work it,\u201d said he. \u201cWe give him the run of the room for exercise, and then at night we put him in his cage. You can let him out by turning the handle from the passage, or you can, as you have seen, coop him up in the same way. No, no, you should not do that!\u201d\nI had put my hand between the bars to pat the glossy, heaving flank. He pulled it back, with a serious face.\n\u201cI assure you that he is not safe. Don\u2019t imagine that because I can take liberties with him anyone else can. He is very exclusive in his friends\u2014aren\u2019t you, Tommy? Ah, he hears his lunch coming to him! Don\u2019t you, boy?\u201d\nA step sounded in the stone-flagged passage, and the creature had sprung to his feet, and was pacing up and down the narrow cage, his yellow eyes gleaming, and his scarlet tongue rippling and quivering over the white line of his jagged teeth. A groom entered with a coarse joint upon a tray, and thrust it through the bars to him. He pounced lightly upon it, carried it off to the corner, and there, holding it between his paws, tore and wrenched at it, raising his bloody muzzle every now and then to look at us. It was a malignant and yet fascinating sight.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wonder that I am fond of him, can you?\u201d said my host, as we left the room, \u201cespecially when you consider that I have had the rearing of him. It was no joke bringing him over from the centre of South America; but here he is safe and sound\u2014and, as I have said, far the most perfect specimen in Europe. The people at the Zoo are dying to have him, but I really can\u2019t part with him. Now, I think that I have inflicted my hobby upon you long enough, so we cannot do better than follow Tommy\u2019s example, and go to our lunch.\u201d\nMy South American relative was so engrossed by his grounds and their curious occupants, that I hardly gave him credit at first for having any interests outside them. That he had some, and pressing ones, was soon borne in upon me by the number of telegrams which he received. They arrived at all hours, and were always opened by him with the utmost eagerness and anxiety upon his face. Sometimes I imagined that it must be the Turf, and sometimes the Stock Exchange, but certainly he had some very urgent business going forwards which was not transacted upon the Downs of Suffolk. During the six days of my visit he had never fewer than three or four telegrams a day, and sometimes as many as seven or eight.\nI had occupied these six days so well, that by the end of them I had succeeded in getting upon the most cordial terms with my cousin. Every night we had sat up late in the billiard-room, he telling me the most extraordinary stories of his adventures in America\u2014stories so desperate and reckless, that I could hardly associate them with the brown little, chubby man before me. In return, I ventured upon some of my own reminiscences of London life, which interested him so much, that he vowed he would come up to Grosvenor Mansions and stay with me. He was anxious to see the faster side of city life, and certainly, though I say it, he could not have chosen a more competent guide. It was not until the last day of my visit that I ventured to approach that which was on my mind. I told him frankly about my pecuniary difficulties and my impending ruin, and I asked his advice\u2014though I hoped for something more solid. He listened attentively, puffing hard at his cigar.\n\u201cBut surely,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are the heir of our relative, Lord Southerton?\u201d\n\u201cI have every reason to believe so, but he would never make me any allowance.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I have heard of his miserly ways. My poor Marshall, your position has been a very hard one. By the way, have you heard any news of Lord Southerton\u2019s health lately?\u201d\n\u201cHe has always been in a critical condition ever since my childhood.\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u2014a creaking hinge, if ever there was one. Your inheritance may be a long way off. Dear me, how awkwardly situated you are!\u201d\n\u201cI had some hopes, sir, that you, knowing all the facts, might be inclined to advance\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say another word, my dear boy,\u201d he cried, with the utmost cordiality; \u201cwe shall talk it over tonight, and I give you my word that whatever is in my power shall be done.\u201d\nI was not sorry that my visit was drawing to a close, for it is unpleasant to feel that there is one person in the house who eagerly desires your departure. Mrs. King\u2019s sallow face and forbidding eyes had become more and more hateful to me. She was no longer actively rude\u2014her fear of her husband prevented her\u2014but she pushed her insane jealousy to the extent of ignoring me, never addressing me, and in every way making my stay at Greylands as uncomfortable as she could. So offensive was her manner during that last day, that I should certainly have left had it not been for that interview with my host in the evening which would, I hoped, retrieve my broken fortunes.\nIt was very late when it occurred, for my relative, who had been receiving even more telegrams than usual during the day, went off to his study after dinner, and only emerged when the household had retired to bed. I heard him go round locking the doors, as custom was of a night, and finally he joined me in the billiard-room. His stout figure was wrapped in a dressing-gown, and he wore a pair of red Turkish slippers without any heels. Settling down into an arm-chair, he brewed himself a glass of grog, in which I could not help noticing that the whisky considerably predominated over the water.\n\u201cMy word!\u201d said he, \u201cwhat a night!\u201d\nIt was, indeed. The wind was howling and screaming round the house, and the latticed windows rattled and shook as if they were coming in. The glow of the yellow lamps and the flavour of our cigars seemed the brighter and more fragrant for the contrast.\n\u201cNow, my boy,\u201d said my host, \u201cwe have the house and the night to ourselves. Let me have an idea of how your affairs stand, and I will see what can be done to set them in order. I wish to hear every detail.\u201d\nThus encouraged, I entered into a long exposition, in which all my tradesmen and creditors from my landlord to my valet, figured in turn. I had notes in my pocket-book, and I marshalled my facts, and gave, I flatter myself, a very businesslike statement of my own unbusinesslike ways and lamentable position. I was depressed, however, to notice that my companion\u2019s eyes were vacant and his attention elsewhere. When he did occasionally throw out a remark it was so entirely perfunctory and pointless, that I was sure he had not in the least followed my remarks. Every now and then he roused himself and put on some show of interest, asking me to repeat or to explain more fully, but it was always to sink once more into the same brown study. At last he rose and threw the end of his cigar into the grate.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, my boy,\u201d said he. \u201cI never had a head for figures, so you will excuse me. You must jot it all down upon paper, and let me have a note of the amount. I\u2019ll understand it when I see it in black and white.\u201d\nThe proposal was encouraging. I promised to do so.\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s time we were in bed. By Jove, there\u2019s one o\u2019clock striking in the hall.\u201d\nThe tingling of the chiming clock broke through the deep roar of the gale. The wind was sweeping past with the rush of a great river.\n\u201cI must see my cat before I go to bed,\u201d said my host. \u201cA high wind excites him. Will you come?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said I.\n\u201cThen tread softly and don\u2019t speak, for everyone is asleep.\u201d\nWe passed quietly down the lamp-lit Persian-rugged hall, and through the door at the farther end. All was dark in the stone corridor, but a stable lantern hung on a hook, and my host took it down and lit it. There was no grating visible in the passage, so I knew that the beast was in its cage.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said my relative, and opened the door.\nA deep growling as we entered showed that the storm had really excited the creature. In the flickering light of the lantern, we saw it, a huge black mass coiled in the corner of its den and throwing a squat, uncouth shadow upon the whitewashed wall. Its tail switched angrily among the straw.\n\u201cPoor Tommy is not in the best of tempers,\u201d said Everard King, holding up the lantern and looking in at him. \u201cWhat a black devil he looks, doesn\u2019t he? I must give him a little supper to put him in a better humour. Would you mind holding the lantern for a moment?\u201d\nI took it from his hand and he stepped to the door.\n\u201cHis larder is just outside here,\u201d said he. \u201cYou will excuse me for an instant won\u2019t you?\u201d He passed out, and the door shut with a sharp metallic click behind him.\nThat hard crisp sound made my heart stand still. A sudden wave of terror passed over me. A vague perception of some monstrous treachery turned me cold. I sprang to the door, but there was no handle upon the inner side.\n\u201cHere!\u201d I cried. \u201cLet me out!\u201d\n\u201cAll right! Don\u2019t make a row!\u201d said my host from the passage. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the light all right.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t care about being locked in alone like this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d I heard his hearty, chuckling laugh. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alone long.\u201d\n\u201cLet me out, sir!\u201d I repeated angrily. \u201cI tell you I don\u2019t allow practical jokes of this sort.\u201d\n\u201cPractical is the word,\u201d said he, with another hateful chuckle. And then suddenly I heard, amidst the roar of the storm, the creak and whine of the winch-handle turning and the rattle of the grating as it passed through the slot. Great God, he was letting loose the Brazilian cat!\nIn the light of the lantern I saw the bars sliding slowly before me. Already there was an opening a foot wide at the farther end. With a scream I seized the last bar with my hands and pulled with the strength of a madman. I WAS a madman with rage and horror. For a minute or more I held the thing motionless. I knew that he was straining with all his force upon the handle, and that the leverage was sure to overcome me. I gave inch by inch, my feet sliding along the stones, and all the time I begged and prayed this inhuman monster to save me from this horrible death. I conjured him by his kinship. I reminded him that I was his guest; I begged to know what harm I had ever done him. His only answers were the tugs and jerks upon the handle, each of which, in spite of all my struggles, pulled another bar through the opening. Clinging and clutching, I was dragged across the whole front of the cage, until at last, with aching wrists and lacerated fingers, I gave up the hopeless struggle. The grating clanged back as I released it, and an instant later I heard the shuffle of the Turkish slippers in the passage, and the slam of the distant door. Then everything was silent.\nThe creature had never moved during this time. He lay still in the corner, and his tail had ceased switching. This apparition of a man adhering to his bars and dragged screaming across him had apparently filled him with amazement. I saw his great eyes staring steadily at me. I had dropped the lantern when I seized the bars, but it still burned upon the floor, and I made a movement to grasp it, with some idea that its light might protect me. But the instant I moved, the beast gave a deep and menacing growl. I stopped and stood still, quivering with fear in every limb. The cat (if one may call so fearful a creature by so homely a name) was not more than ten feet from me. The eyes glimmered like two disks of phosphorus in the darkness. They appalled and yet fascinated me. I could not take my own eyes from them. Nature plays strange tricks with us at such moments of intensity, and those glimmering lights waxed and waned with a steady rise and fall. Sometimes they seemed to be tiny points of extreme brilliancy\u2014little electric sparks in the black obscurity\u2014then they would widen and widen until all that corner of the room was filled with their shifting and sinister light. And then suddenly they went out altogether.\nThe beast had closed its eyes. I do not know whether there may be any truth in the old idea of the dominance of the human gaze, or whether the huge cat was simply drowsy, but the fact remains that, far from showing any symptom of attacking me, it simply rested its sleek, black head upon its huge forepaws and seemed to sleep. I stood, fearing to move lest I should rouse it into malignant life once more. But at least I was able to think clearly now that the baleful eyes were off me. Here I was shut up for the night with the ferocious beast. My own instincts, to say nothing of the words of the plausible villain who laid this trap for me, warned me that the animal was as savage as its master. How could I stave it off until morning? The door was hopeless, and so were the narrow, barred windows. There was no shelter anywhere in the bare, stone-flagged room. To cry for assistance was absurd. I knew that this den was an outhouse, and that the corridor which connected it with the house was at least a hundred feet long. Besides, with the gale thundering outside, my cries were not likely to be heard. I had only my own courage and my own wits to trust to.\nAnd then, with a fresh wave of horror, my eyes fell upon the lantern. The candle had burned low, and was already beginning to gutter. In ten minutes it would be out. I had only ten minutes then in which to do something, for I felt that if I were once left in the dark with that fearful beast I should be incapable of action. The very thought of it paralysed me. I cast my despairing eyes round this chamber of death, and they rested upon one spot which seemed to promise I will not say safety, but less immediate and imminent danger than the open floor.\nI have said that the cage had a top as well as a front, and this top was left standing when the front was wound through the slot in the wall. It consisted of bars at a few inches\u2019 interval, with stout wire netting between, and it rested upon a strong stanchion at each end. It stood now as a great barred canopy over the crouching figure in the corner. The space between this iron shelf and the roof may have been from two or three feet. If I could only get up there, squeezed in between bars and ceiling, I should have only one vulnerable side. I should be safe from below, from behind, and from each side. Only on the open face of it could I be attacked. There, it is true, I had no protection whatever; but at least, I should be out of the brute\u2019s path when he began to pace about his den. He would have to come out of his way to reach me. It was now or never, for if once the light were out it would be impossible. With a gulp in my throat I sprang up, seized the iron edge of the top, and swung myself panting on to it. I writhed in face downwards, and found myself looking straight into the terrible eyes and yawning jaws of the cat. Its fetid breath came up into my face like the steam from some foul pot.\nIt appeared, however, to be rather curious than angry. With a sleek ripple of its long, black back it rose, stretched itself, and then rearing itself on its hind legs, with one forepaw against the wall, it raised the other, and drew its claws across the wire meshes beneath me. One sharp, white hook tore through my trousers\u2014for I may mention that I was still in evening dress\u2014and dug a furrow in my knee. It was not meant as an attack, but rather as an experiment, for upon my giving a sharp cry of pain he dropped down again, and springing lightly into the room, he began walking swiftly round it, looking up every now and again in my direction. For my part I shuffled backwards until I lay with my back against the wall, screwing myself into the smallest space possible. The farther I got the more difficult it was for him to attack me.\nHe seemed more excited now that he had begun to move about, and he ran swiftly and noiselessly round and round the den, passing continually underneath the iron couch upon which I lay. It was wonderful to see so great a bulk passing like a shadow, with hardly the softest thudding of velvety pads. The candle was burning low\u2014so low that I could hardly see the creature. And then, with a last flare and splutter it went out altogether. I was alone with the cat in the dark!\nIt helps one to face a danger when one knows that one has done all that possibly can be done. There is nothing for it then but to quietly await the result. In this case, there was no chance of safety anywhere except the precise spot where I was. I stretched myself out, therefore, and lay silently, almost breathlessly, hoping that the beast might forget my presence if I did nothing to remind him. I reckoned that it must already be two o\u2019clock. At four it would be full dawn. I had not more than two hours to wait for daylight.\nOutside, the storm was still raging, and the rain lashed continually against the little windows. Inside, the poisonous and fetid air was overpowering. I could neither hear nor see the cat. I tried to think about other things\u2014but only one had power enough to draw my mind from my terrible position. That was the contemplation of my cousin\u2019s villainy, his unparalleled hypocrisy, his malignant hatred of me. Beneath that cheerful face there lurked the spirit of a mediaeval assassin. And as I thought of it I saw more clearly how cunningly the thing had been arranged. He had apparently gone to bed with the others. No doubt he had his witness to prove it. Then, unknown to them, he had slipped down, had lured me into his den and abandoned me. His story would be so simple. He had left me to finish my cigar in the billiard-room. I had gone down on my own account to have a last look at the cat. I had entered the room without observing that the cage was opened, and I had been caught. How could such a crime be brought home to him? Suspicion, perhaps\u2014but proof, never!\nHow slowly those dreadful two hours went by! Once I heard a low, rasping sound, which I took to be the creature licking its own fur. Several times those greenish eyes gleamed at me through the darkness, but never in a fixed stare, and my hopes grew stronger that my presence had been forgotten or ignored. At last the least faint glimmer of light came through the windows\u2014I first dimly saw them as two grey squares upon the black wall, then grey turned to white, and I could see my terrible companion once more. And he, alas, could see me!\nIt was evident to me at once that he was in a much more dangerous and aggressive mood than when I had seen him last. The cold of the morning had irritated him, and he was hungry as well. With a continual growl he paced swiftly up and down the side of the room which was farthest from my refuge, his whiskers bristling angrily, and his tail switching and lashing. As he turned at the corners his savage eyes always looked upwards at me with a dreadful menace. I knew then that he meant to kill me. Yet I found myself even at that moment admiring the sinuous grace of the devilish thing, its long, undulating, rippling movements, the gloss of its beautiful flanks, the vivid, palpitating scarlet of the glistening tongue which hung from the jet-black muzzle. And all the time that deep, threatening growl was rising and rising in an unbroken crescendo. I knew that the crisis was at hand.\nIt was a miserable hour to meet such a death\u2014so cold, so comfortless, shivering in my light dress clothes upon this gridiron of torment upon which I was stretched. I tried to brace myself to it, to raise my soul above it, and at the same time, with the lucidity which comes to a perfectly desperate man, I cast round for some possible means of escape. One thing was clear to me. If that front of the cage was only back in its position once more, I could find a sure refuge behind it. Could I possibly pull it back? I hardly dared to move for fear of bringing the creature upon me. Slowly, very slowly, I put my hand forward until it grasped the edge of the front, the final bar which protruded through the wall. To my surprise it came quite easily to my jerk. Of course the difficulty of drawing it out arose from the fact that I was clinging to it. I pulled again, and three inches of it came through. It ran apparently on wheels. I pulled again ... and then the cat sprang!\nIt was so quick, so sudden, that I never saw it happen. I simply heard the savage snarl, and in an instant afterwards the blazing yellow eyes, the flattened black head with its red tongue and flashing teeth, were within reach of me. The impact of the creature shook the bars upon which I lay, until I thought (as far as I could think of anything at such a moment) that they were coming down. The cat swayed there for an instant, the head and front paws quite close to me, the hind paws clawing to find a grip upon the edge of the grating. I heard the claws rasping as they clung to the wire-netting, and the breath of the beast made me sick. But its bound had been miscalculated. It could not retain its position. Slowly, grinning with rage, and scratching madly at the bars, it swung backwards and dropped heavily upon the floor. With a growl it instantly faced round to me and crouched for another spring.\nI knew that the next few moments would decide my fate. The creature had learned by experience. It would not miscalculate again. I must act promptly, fearlessly, if I were to have a chance for life. In an instant I had formed my plan. Pulling off my dress-coat, I threw it down over the head of the beast. At the same moment I dropped over the edge, seized the end of the front grating, and pulled it frantically out of the wall.\nIt came more easily than I could have expected. I rushed across the room, bearing it with me; but, as I rushed, the accident of my position put me upon the outer side. Had it been the other way, I might have come off scathless. As it was, there was a moment\u2019s pause as I stopped it and tried to pass in through the opening which I had left. That moment was enough to give time to the creature to toss off the coat with which I had blinded him and to spring upon me. I hurled myself through the gap and pulled the rails to behind me, but he seized my leg before I could entirely withdraw it. One stroke of that huge paw tore off my calf as a shaving of wood curls off before a plane. The next moment, bleeding and fainting, I was lying among the foul straw with a line of friendly bars between me and the creature which ramped so frantically against them.\nToo wounded to move, and too faint to be conscious of fear, I could only lie, more dead than alive, and watch it. It pressed its broad, black chest against the bars and angled for me with its crooked paws as I have seen a kitten do before a mouse-trap. It ripped my clothes, but, stretch as it would, it could not quite reach me. I have heard of the curious numbing effect produced by wounds from the great carnivora, and now I was destined to experience it, for I had lost all sense of personality, and was as interested in the cat\u2019s failure or success as if it were some game which I was watching. And then gradually my mind drifted away into strange vague dreams, always with that black face and red tongue coming back into them, and so I lost myself in the nirvana of delirium, the blessed relief of those who are too sorely tried.\nTracing the course of events afterwards, I conclude that I must have been insensible for about two hours. What roused me to consciousness once more was that sharp metallic click which had been the precursor of my terrible experience. It was the shooting back of the spring lock. Then, before my senses were clear enough to entirely apprehend what they saw, I was aware of the round, benevolent face of my cousin peering in through the open door. What he saw evidently amazed him. There was the cat crouching on the floor. I was stretched upon my back in my shirt-sleeves within the cage, my trousers torn to ribbons and a great pool of blood all round me. I can see his amazed face now, with the morning sunlight upon it. He peered at me, and peered again. Then he closed the door behind him, and advanced to the cage to see if I were really dead.\nI cannot undertake to say what happened. I was not in a fit state to witness or to chronicle such events. I can only say that I was suddenly conscious that his face was away from me\u2014that he was looking towards the animal.\n\u201cGood old Tommy!\u201d he cried. \u201cGood old Tommy!\u201d\nThen he came near the bars, with his back still towards me.\n\u201cDown, you stupid beast!\u201d he roared. \u201cDown, sir! Don\u2019t you know your master?\u201d\nSuddenly even in my bemuddled brain a remembrance came of those words of his when he had said that the taste of blood would turn the cat into a fiend. My blood had done it, but he was to pay the price.\n\u201cGet away!\u201d he screamed. \u201cGet away, you devil! Baldwin! Baldwin! Oh, my God!\u201d\nAnd then I heard him fall, and rise, and fall again, with a sound like the ripping of sacking. His screams grew fainter until they were lost in the worrying snarl. And then, after I thought that he was dead, I saw, as in a nightmare, a blinded, tattered, blood-soaked figure running wildly round the room\u2014and that was the last glimpse which I had of him before I fainted once again.\n \nI was many months in my recovery\u2014in fact, I cannot say that I have ever recovered, for to the end of my days I shall carry a stick as a sign of my night with the Brazilian cat. Baldwin, the groom, and the other servants could not tell what had occurred, when, drawn by the death-cries of their master, they found me behind the bars, and his remains\u2014or what they afterwards discovered to be his remains\u2014in the clutch of the creature which he had reared. They stalled him off with hot irons, and afterwards shot him through the loophole of the door before they could finally extricate me. I was carried to my bedroom, and there, under the roof of my would-be murderer, I remained between life and death for several weeks. They had sent for a surgeon from Clipton and a nurse from London, and in a month I was able to be carried to the station, and so conveyed back once more to Grosvenor Mansions.\nI have one remembrance of that illness, which might have been part of the ever-changing panorama conjured up by a delirious brain were it not so definitely fixed in my memory. One night, when the nurse was absent, the door of my chamber opened, and a tall woman in blackest mourning slipped into the room. She came across to me, and as she bent her sallow face I saw by the faint gleam of the night-light that it was the Brazilian woman whom my cousin had married. She stared intently into my face, and her expression was more kindly than I had ever seen it.\n\u201cAre you conscious?\u201d she asked.\nI feebly nodded\u2014for I was still very weak.\n\u201cWell; then, I only wished to say to you that you have yourself to blame. Did I not do all I could for you? From the beginning I tried to drive you from the house. By every means, short of betraying my husband, I tried to save you from him. I knew that he had a reason for bringing you here. I knew that he would never let you get away again. No one knew him as I knew him, who had suffered from him so often. I did not dare to tell you all this. He would have killed me. But I did my best for you. As things have turned out, you have been the best friend that I have ever had. You have set me free, and I fancied that nothing but death would do that. I am sorry if you are hurt, but I cannot reproach myself. I told you that you were a fool\u2014and a fool you have been.\u201d She crept out of the room, the bitter, singular woman, and I was never destined to see her again. With what remained from her husband\u2019s property she went back to her native land, and I have heard that she afterwards took the veil at Pernambuco.\nIt was not until I had been back in London for some time that the doctors pronounced me to be well enough to do business. It was not a very welcome permission to me, for I feared that it would be the signal for an inrush of creditors; but it was Summers, my lawyer, who first took advantage of it.\n\u201cI am very glad to see that your lordship is so much better,\u201d said he. \u201cI have been waiting a long time to offer my congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Summers? This is no time for joking.\u201d\n\u201cI mean what I say,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou have been Lord Southerton for the last six weeks, but we feared that it would retard your recovery if you were to learn it.\u201d\nLord Southerton! One of the richest peers in England! I could not believe my ears. And then suddenly I thought of the time which had elapsed, and how it coincided with my injuries.\n\u201cThen Lord Southerton must have died about the same time that I was hurt?\u201d\n\u201cHis death occurred upon that very day.\u201d Summers looked hard at me as I spoke, and I am convinced\u2014for he was a very shrewd fellow\u2014that he had guessed the true state of the case. He paused for a moment as if awaiting a confidence from me, but I could not see what was to be gained by exposing such a family scandal.\n\u201cYes, a very curious coincidence,\u201d he continued, with the same knowing look. \u201cOf course, you are aware that your cousin Everard King was the next heir to the estates. Now, if it had been you instead of him who had been torn to pieces by this tiger, or whatever it was, then of course he would have been Lord Southerton at the present moment.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d said I.\n\u201cAnd he took such an interest in it,\u201d said Summers. \u201cI happen to know that the late Lord Southerton\u2019s valet was in his pay, and that he used to have telegrams from him every few hours to tell him how he was getting on. That would be about the time when you were down there. Was it not strange that he should wish to be so well informed, since he knew that he was not the direct heir?\u201d\n\u201cVery strange,\u201d said I. \u201cAnd now, Summers, if you will bring me my bills and a new cheque-book, we will begin to get things into order.\u201d\n"

                "content": "\nHigh up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest, stands the old chateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the moss-grown castle walls. These ancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all France. From its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons, Counts, and even Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invader.\nBut since those glorious years all is changed. A poverty but little above the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour; and the falling stones of the walls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill-paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the sagging floors, the worm-eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within, all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur. As the ages passed, first one, then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin, until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate.\nIt was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that I, Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Comtes de C\u2014\u2014, first saw the light of day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls, and amongst the dark and shadowy forests, the wild ravines and grottoes of the hillside below, were spent the first years of my troubled life. My parents I never knew. My father had been killed at the age of thirty-two, a month before I was born, by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle; and my mother having died at my birth, my care and education devolved solely upon one remaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence, whose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only child, and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill. At the time, Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company. Now I know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line, that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearths.\nThus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow-haunted library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot. It was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy. Those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in Nature most strongly claimed my attention.\nOf my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what small knowledge of it I was able to gain, seemed to depress me much. Perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I ever felt at the mention of my great house; yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now became dimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at which all the Comtes of my line had met their end. Whilst I had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of short-lived men, I afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths, and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man, who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirty-two years. Upon my twenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son, and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of the most startling nature, and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions. At this time, my belief in the supernatural was firm and deep-seated, else I should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes.\nThe paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when the old castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress. It told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our estates, a person of no small accomplishments, though little above the rank of peasant; by name, Michel, usually designated by the surname of Mauvais, the Evil, on account of his sinister reputation. He had studied beyond the custom of his kind, seeking such things as the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvais had one son, named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts, and who had therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the Wizard. This pair, shunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous practices. Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two. Yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection.\nOne night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri the Comte. A searching party, headed by the frantic father, invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron. Without certain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair, the Comte laid hands on the aged wizard, and ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no more. Meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young Godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that poor Michel had been killed in vain. As the Comte and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists, the form of Charles Le Sorcier appeared through the trees. The excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred, yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father\u2019s fate. Then, slowly advancing to meet the Comte, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of C\u2014\u2014.\n \n   \u201cMay ne\u2019er a noble of thy murd\u2019rous line\n   Survive to reach a greater age than thine!\u201d\n \nspake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood, he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his father\u2019s slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night. The Comte died without utterance, and was buried the next day, but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No trace of the assassin could be found, though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighbouring woods and the meadow-land around the hill.\nThus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the minds of the late Comte\u2019s family, so that when Godfrey, innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an arrow whilst hunting, at the age of thirty-two, there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise. But when, years afterward, the next young Comte, Robert by name, was found dead in a nearby field from no apparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his thirty-second birthday when surprised by early death. Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle; Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder.\nThat I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which I read. My life, previously held at small value, now became dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic. Isolated as I was, modern science had produced no impression upon me, and I laboured as in the Middle Ages, as wrapt as had been old Michel and young Charles themselves in the acquisition of daemonological and alchemical learning. Yet read as I might, in no manner could I account for the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments, I would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation, attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister Charles Le Sorcier and his heirs; yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist, I would fall back to occult studies, and once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house from its terrible burden. Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved. I should never wed, for since no other branches of my family were in existence, I might thus end the curse with myself.\nAs I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land beyond. Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met. Much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which, old Pierre had once told me, had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries. Strange and awesome were many of the objects I encountered. Furniture, covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness, met my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere, and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom.\nOf my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence. At length I approached that time which I had so long viewed with apprehension. Since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of Comte Henri at his end, I was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death. In what strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was resolved, at least, that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With new vigour I applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents.\nIt was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which I felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond which I could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath, that I came upon the culminating event of my whole life. I had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half-ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels, descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed the nitre-encrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase, the paving became very damp, and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank, water-stained wall impeded my journey. Turning to retrace my steps, my eye fell upon a small trap-door with a ring, which lay directly beneath my feet. Pausing, I succeeded with difficulty in raising it, whereupon there was revealed a black aperture, exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter, and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps. As soon as the torch, which I lowered into the repellent depths, burned freely and steadily, I commenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to a narrow stone-flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. The passage proved of great length, and terminated in a massive oaken door, dripping with the moisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it. Ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction, I had proceeded back some distance toward the steps, when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind. Without warning, I heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hinges. My immediate sensations are incapable of analysis. To be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit, produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description. When at last I turned and faced the seat of the sound, my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld. There in the ancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a man clad in a skull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour. His long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible profusion. His forehead, high beyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep-sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like, and gnarled, were of such a deathly, marble-like whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man. His figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But strangest of all were his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness, profound in expression of understanding, yet inhuman in degree of wickedness. These were now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their hatred, and rooting me to the spot whereon I stood. At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence. The language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned men of the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and daemonologists. The apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house, told me of my coming end, dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old Michel Mauvais, and gloated over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told how the young Charles had escaped into the night, returning in after years to kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his father\u2019s at his assassination; how he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself, unknown, in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator; how he had seized Robert, son of Godfrey, in a field, forced poison down his throat, and left him to die at the age of thirty-two, thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this point I was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of Nature have died, for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles Le Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth.\nHis enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them, but suddenly the fiendish glare returned, and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had Charles Le Sorcier, six hundred years before, ended that of my ancestor. Prompted by some preserving instinct of self-defence, I broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would-be assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.\nWhen at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind remembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more; yet curiosity overmastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of evil, and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to avenge the death of poor Michel Mauvais, and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of Charles Le Sorcier? The dread of years was lifted from my shoulders, for I knew that he whom I had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse; and now that I was free, I burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries, and made of my own youth one long-continued nightmare. Determined upon further exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the unused torch which I had with me. First of all, the new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what seemed much like an alchemist\u2019s laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch. It may have been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I was strangely affected by that which I had undergone. At the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest. Filled with wonder, yet now realising how the man had obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded to return. I had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face, but as I approached the body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct. Aghast, I turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor. Then all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face in which they were set, opened wide with an expression which I was unable to interpret. The cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not well understand. Once I caught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again I fancied that the words \u201cyears\u201d and \u201ccurse\u201d issued from the twisted mouth. Still I was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech. At my evident ignorance of his meaning, the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me, until, helpless as I saw my opponent to be, I trembled as I watched him.\nSuddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I remained, paralysed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights. \u201cFool,\u201d he shrieked, \u201ccan you not guess my secret? Have you no brain whereby you may recognise the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house? Have I not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? Know you not how the secret of Alchemy was solved? I tell you, it is I! I! I! that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge, FOR I AM CHARLES LE SORCIER!\u201d\n"

                "content": "\nI.\nMost of us see some romances in life. In my capacity as Chief Manager of a Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen more romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the opportunity may, at first sight, seem.\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used to want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure. My experiences have a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were in progress. I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the scenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the glare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner. The art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human creature to present his or her own page with the individual character written on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied. It may require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything does) some patience and some pains. That these are not usually given to it,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of the face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know the refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great deal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the face of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to you,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable. Perhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial expression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to you to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\nI confess, for my part, that I have been taken in, over and over again. I have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of course) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of persons. How came I to be so deceived? Had I quite misread their faces?\nNo. Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and manner alone, was invariably true. My mistake was in suffering them to come nearer to me and explain themselves away.\nII.\nThe partition which separated my own office from our general outer office in the City was of thick plate-glass. I could see through it what passed in the outer office, without hearing a word. I had it put up in place of a wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built. It is no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I might derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on business, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything they said. Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that account, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be practised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose story I am going to tell.\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella on the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from one of the clerks. He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well dressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a polite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it. His hair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the middle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my thinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you please, my friend, just as I show myself. Come straight up here, follow the gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them to him and explaining them. An obliged and agreeable smile was on his face, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look. (I have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face. Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea. Dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to be got by it.)\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking at him. Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass partition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if you please. Off the grass!\u2019\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was gone.\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand. \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle Temple.\u2019\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend here,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for orders.\u2019\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen altogether.\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\u2018Recommended here? Did he say?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours. He noticed you, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\u2018O yes, sir! He said, \u201cThere is Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I. \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a merchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man I saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton. There he was, standing before the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but still (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way he offered, and by no other.\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my friend did so. Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me. Not too happy; there was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred, perfectly unmeaning way.\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton. \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your recommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr. Sampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary clerk.\u2019\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s introduction.\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged. At another time, perhaps, I may be less delicate. Only, however, if I have real business; for I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast number of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow. \u2018You were thinking,\u2019 said I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\u2018O dear no! I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment of supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson. I merely inquired for a friend. But you know what friends are in such matters. Nothing may ever come of it. I have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries for friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the friends will never follow them up. People are so fickle, so selfish, so inconsiderate. Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr. Sampson?\u2019\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white parting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new cook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has recently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No, in talent and vigour.\u2019\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment. \u2018Has it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I. \u2018I was not aware of it.\u2019\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson. I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired. It is not so bad as that. But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I. \u2018Yes! Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the \u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\u2018He is a great loss. He was at once the most profound, the most original, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with Life Assurance.\u2019\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and my gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he wanted to sneer at him. He recalled me to my guard by presenting that trim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you please\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\u2018Only by reputation. To have known him as an acquaintance or as a friend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society, though I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man of far inferior mark. He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way. \u2018What creatures we are! To break up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of life!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him. \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track, and I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked, point-blank.\n\u2018Most likely a false one. You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson. I never repeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving the head of Rumour. But when you ask me what reason I have heard assigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another thing. I am not gratifying idle gossip then. I was told, Mr. Sampson, that Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his prospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted. A disappointed attachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man so distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018O, she died? Pray pardon me. I did not hear that. That, indeed, makes it very, very sad. Poor Mr. Meltham! She died? Ah, dear me! Lamentable, lamentable!\u2019\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an unaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted, like the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man whom I have never known. I am not so disinterested as you may suppose. I have suffered, and recently too, from death myself. I have lost one of two charming nieces, who were my constant companions. She died young\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from strong. The world is a grave!\u2019\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of my manner. Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by my bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how much I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had gained, gaining hard caution. This state of mind being habitual to me, I troubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled myself about a greater matter. I listened to his talk at dinner, and observed how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful instinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he talked with. As, in talking with me, he had easily started the subject I might be supposed to understand best, and to be the most interested in, so, in talking with others, he guided himself by the same rule. The company was of a varied character; but he was not at fault, that I could discover, with any member of it. He knew just as much of each man\u2019s pursuit as made him agreeable to that man in reference to it, and just as little as made it natural in him to seek modestly for information when the theme was broached.\nAs he talked and talked\u2014but really not too much, for the rest of us seemed to force it upon him\u2014I became quite angry with myself. I took his face to pieces in my mind, like a watch, and examined it in detail. I could not say much against any of his features separately; I could say even less against them when they were put together. \u2018Then is it not monstrous,\u2019 I asked myself, \u2018that because a man happens to part his hair straight up the middle of his head, I should permit myself to suspect, and even to detest him?\u2019\n(I may stop to remark that this was no proof of my sense. An observer of men who finds himself steadily repelled by some apparently trifling thing in a stranger is right to give it great weight. It may be the clue to the whole mystery. A hair or two will show where a lion is hidden. A very little key will open a very heavy door.)\nI took my part in the conversation with him after a time, and we got on remarkably well. In the drawing-room I asked the host how long he had known Mr. Slinkton. He answered, not many months; he had met him at the house of a celebrated painter then present, who had known him well when he was travelling with his nieces in Italy for their health. His plans in life being broken by the death of one of them, he was reading with the intention of going back to college as a matter of form, taking his degree, and going into orders. I could not but argue with myself that here was the true explanation of his interest in poor Meltham, and that I had been almost brutal in my distrust on that simple head.\nIII.\nOn the very next day but one I was sitting behind my glass partition, as before, when he came into the outer office, as before. The moment I saw him again without hearing him, I hated him worse than ever.\nIt was only for a moment that I had this opportunity; for he waved his tight-fitting black glove the instant I looked at him, and came straight in.\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, good-day! I presume, you see, upon your kind permission to intrude upon you. I don\u2019t keep my word in being justified by business, for my business here\u2014if I may so abuse the word\u2014is of the slightest nature.\u2019\nI asked, was it anything I could assist him in?\n\u2018I thank you, no. I merely called to inquire outside whether my dilatory friend had been so false to himself as to be practical and sensible. But, of course, he has done nothing. I gave him your papers with my own hand, and he was hot upon the intention, but of course he has done nothing. Apart from the general human disinclination to do anything that ought to be done, I dare say there is a specialty about assuring one\u2019s life. You find it like will-making. People are so superstitious, and take it for granted they will die soon afterwards.\u2019\n\u2018Up here, if you please; straight up here, Mr. Sampson. Neither to the right nor to the left.\u2019 I almost fancied I could hear him breathe the words as he sat smiling at me, with that intolerable parting exactly opposite the bridge of my nose.\n\u2018There is such a feeling sometimes, no doubt,\u2019 I replied; \u2018but I don\u2019t think it obtains to any great extent.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, with a shrug and a smile, \u2018I wish some good angel would influence my friend in the right direction. I rashly promised his mother and sister in Norfolk to see it done, and he promised them that he would do it. But I suppose he never will.\u2019\nHe spoke for a minute or two on indifferent topics, and went away.\nI had scarcely unlocked the drawers of my writing-table next morning, when he reappeared. I noticed that he came straight to the door in the glass partition, and did not pause a single moment outside.\n\u2018Can you spare me two minutes, my dear Mr. Sampson?\u2019\n\u2018By all means.\u2019\n\u2018Much obliged,\u2019 laying his hat and umbrella on the table; \u2018I came early, not to interrupt you. The fact is, I am taken by surprise in reference to this proposal my friend has made.\u2019\n\u2018Has he made one?\u2019 said I.\n\u2018Ye-es,\u2019 he answered, deliberately looking at me; and then a bright idea seemed to strike him\u2014\u2018or he only tells me he has. Perhaps that may be a new way of evading the matter. By Jupiter, I never thought of that!\u2019\nMr. Adams was opening the morning\u2019s letters in the outer office. \u2018What is the name, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018Beckwith.\u2019\nI looked out at the door and requested Mr. Adams, if there were a proposal in that name, to bring it in. He had already laid it out of his hand on the counter. It was easily selected from the rest, and he gave it me. Alfred Beckwith. Proposal to effect a policy with us for two thousand pounds. Dated yesterday.\n\u2018From the Middle Temple, I see, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\u2018Yes. He lives on the same staircase with me; his door is opposite. I never thought he would make me his reference though.\u2019\n\u2018It seems natural enough that he should.\u2019\n\u2018Quite so, Mr. Sampson; but I never thought of it. Let me see.\u2019 He took the printed paper from his pocket. \u2018How am I to answer all these questions?\u2019\n\u2018According to the truth, of course,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018O, of course!\u2019 he answered, looking up from the paper with a smile; \u2018I meant they were so many. But you do right to be particular. It stands to reason that you must be particular. Will you allow me to use your pen and ink?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\n\u2018And your desk?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\nHe had been hovering about between his hat and his umbrella for a place to write on. He now sat down in my chair, at my blotting-paper and inkstand, with the long walk up his head in accurate perspective before me, as I stood with my back to the fire.\nBefore answering each question he ran over it aloud, and discussed it. How long had he known Mr. Alfred Beckwith? That he had to calculate by years upon his fingers. What were his habits? No difficulty about them; temperate in the last degree, and took a little too much exercise, if anything. All the answers were satisfactory. When he had written them all, he looked them over, and finally signed them in a very pretty hand. He supposed he had now done with the business. I told him he was not likely to be troubled any farther. Should he leave the papers there? If he pleased. Much obliged. Good-morning.\nI had had one other visitor before him; not at the office, but at my own house. That visitor had come to my bedside when it was not yet daylight, and had been seen by no one else but by my faithful confidential servant.\nA second reference paper (for we required always two) was sent down into Norfolk, and was duly received back by post. This, likewise, was satisfactorily answered in every respect. Our forms were all complied with; we accepted the proposal, and the premium for one year was paid.\nIV.\nFor six or seven months I saw no more of Mr. Slinkton. He called once at my house, but I was not at home; and he once asked me to dine with him in the Temple, but I was engaged. His friend\u2019s assurance was effected in March. Late in September or early in October I was down at Scarborough for a breath of sea-air, where I met him on the beach. It was a hot evening; he came toward me with his hat in his hand; and there was the walk I had felt so strongly disinclined to take in perfect order again, exactly in front of the bridge of my nose.\nHe was not alone, but had a young lady on his arm.\nShe was dressed in mourning, and I looked at her with great interest. She had the appearance of being extremely delicate, and her face was remarkably pale and melancholy; but she was very pretty. He introduced her as his niece, Miss Niner.\n\u2018Are you strolling, Mr. Sampson? Is it possible you can be idle?\u2019\nIt was possible, and I was strolling.\n\u2018Shall we stroll together?\u2019\n\u2018With pleasure.\u2019\nThe young lady walked between us, and we walked on the cool sea sand, in the direction of Filey.\n\u2018There have been wheels here,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton. \u2018And now I look again, the wheels of a hand-carriage! Margaret, my love, your shadow without doubt!\u2019\n\u2018Miss Niner\u2019s shadow?\u2019 I repeated, looking down at it on the sand.\n\u2018Not that one,\u2019 Mr. Slinkton returned, laughing. \u2018Margaret, my dear, tell Mr. Sampson.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed,\u2019 said the young lady, turning to me, \u2018there is nothing to tell\u2014except that I constantly see the same invalid old gentleman at all times, wherever I go. I have mentioned it to my uncle, and he calls the gentleman my shadow.\u2019\n\u2018Does he live in Scarborough?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018He is staying here.\u2019\n\u2018Do you live in Scarborough?\u2019\n\u2018No, I am staying here. My uncle has placed me with a family here, for my health.\u2019\n\u2018And your shadow?\u2019 said I, smiling.\n\u2018My shadow,\u2019 she answered, smiling too, \u2018is\u2014like myself\u2014not very robust, I fear; for I lose my shadow sometimes, as my shadow loses me at other times. We both seem liable to confinement to the house. I have not seen my shadow for days and days; but it does oddly happen, occasionally, that wherever I go, for many days together, this gentleman goes. We have come together in the most unfrequented nooks on this shore.\u2019\n\u2018Is this he?\u2019 said I, pointing before us.\nThe wheels had swept down to the water\u2019s edge, and described a great loop on the sand in turning. Bringing the loop back towards us, and spinning it out as it came, was a hand-carriage, drawn by a man.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Miss Niner, \u2018this really is my shadow, uncle.\u2019\nAs the carriage approached us and we approached the carriage, I saw within it an old man, whose head was sunk on his breast, and who was enveloped in a variety of wrappers. He was drawn by a very quiet but very keen-looking man, with iron-gray hair, who was slightly lame. They had passed us, when the carriage stopped, and the old gentleman within, putting out his arm, called to me by my name. I went back, and was absent from Mr. Slinkton and his niece for about five minutes.\nWhen I rejoined them, Mr. Slinkton was the first to speak. Indeed, he said to me in a raised voice before I came up with him:\n\u2018It is well you have not been longer, or my niece might have died of curiosity to know who her shadow is, Mr. Sampson.\u2019\n\u2018An old East India Director,\u2019 said I. \u2018An intimate friend of our friend\u2019s, at whose house I first had the pleasure of meeting you. A certain Major Banks. You have heard of him?\u2019\n\u2018Never.\u2019\n\u2018Very rich, Miss Niner; but very old, and very crippled. An amiable man, sensible\u2014much interested in you. He has just been expatiating on the affection that he has observed to exist between you and your uncle.\u2019\nMr. Slinkton was holding his hat again, and he passed his hand up the straight walk, as if he himself went up it serenely, after me.\n\u2018Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he said, tenderly pressing his niece\u2019s arm in his, \u2018our affection was always a strong one, for we have had but few near ties. We have still fewer now. We have associations to bring us together, that are not of this world, Margaret.\u2019\n\u2018Dear uncle!\u2019 murmured the young lady, and turned her face aside to hide her tears.\n\u2018My niece and I have such remembrances and regrets in common, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he feelingly pursued, \u2018that it would be strange indeed if the relations between us were cold or indifferent. If I remember a conversation we once had together, you will understand the reference I make. Cheer up, dear Margaret. Don\u2019t droop, don\u2019t droop. My Margaret! I cannot bear to see you droop!\u2019\nThe poor young lady was very much affected, but controlled herself. His feelings, too, were very acute. In a word, he found himself under such great need of a restorative, that he presently went away, to take a bath of sea-water, leaving the young lady and me sitting by a point of rock, and probably presuming\u2014but that you will say was a pardonable indulgence in a luxury\u2014that she would praise him with all her heart.\nShe did, poor thing! With all her confiding heart, she praised him to me, for his care of her dead sister, and for his untiring devotion in her last illness. The sister had wasted away very slowly, and wild and terrible fantasies had come over her toward the end, but he had never been impatient with her, or at a loss; had always been gentle, watchful, and self-possessed. The sister had known him, as she had known him, to be the best of men, the kindest of men, and yet a man of such admirable strength of character, as to be a very tower for the support of their weak natures while their poor lives endured.\n\u2018I shall leave him, Mr. Sampson, very soon,\u2019 said the young lady; \u2018I know my life is drawing to an end; and when I am gone, I hope he will marry and be happy. I am sure he has lived single so long, only for my sake, and for my poor, poor sister\u2019s.\u2019\nThe little hand-carriage had made another great loop on the damp sand, and was coming back again, gradually spinning out a slim figure of eight, half a mile long.\n\u2018Young lady,\u2019 said I, looking around, laying my hand upon her arm, and speaking in a low voice, \u2018time presses. You hear the gentle murmur of that sea?\u2019\nShe looked at me with the utmost wonder and alarm, saying, \u2018Yes!\u2019\n\u2018And you know what a voice is in it when the storm comes?\u2019\n\u2018Yes!\u2019\n\u2018You see how quiet and peaceful it lies before us, and you know what an awful sight of power without pity it might be, this very night!\u2019\n\u2018Yes!\u2019\n\u2018But if you had never heard or seen it, or heard of it in its cruelty, could you believe that it beats every inanimate thing in its way to pieces, without mercy, and destroys life without remorse?\u2019\n\u2018You terrify me, sir, by these questions!\u2019\n\u2018To save you, young lady, to save you! For God\u2019s sake, collect your strength and collect your firmness! If you were here alone, and hemmed in by the rising tide on the flow to fifty feet above your head, you could not be in greater danger than the danger you are now to be saved from.\u2019\nThe figure on the sand was spun out, and straggled off into a crooked little jerk that ended at the cliff very near us.\n\u2018As I am, before Heaven and the Judge of all mankind, your friend, and your dead sister\u2019s friend, I solemnly entreat you, Miss Niner, without one moment\u2019s loss of time, to come to this gentleman with me!\u2019\nIf the little carriage had been less near to us, I doubt if I could have got her away; but it was so near that we were there before she had recovered the hurry of being urged from the rock. I did not remain there with her two minutes. Certainly within five, I had the inexpressible satisfaction of seeing her\u2014from the point we had sat on, and to which I had returned\u2014half supported and half carried up some rude steps notched in the cliff, by the figure of an active man. With that figure beside her, I knew she was safe anywhere.\nI sat alone on the rock, awaiting Mr. Slinkton\u2019s return. The twilight was deepening and the shadows were heavy, when he came round the point, with his hat hanging at his button-hole, smoothing his wet hair with one of his hands, and picking out the old path with the other and a pocket-comb.\n\u2018My niece not here, Mr. Sampson?\u2019 he said, looking about.\n\u2018Miss Niner seemed to feel a chill in the air after the sun was down, and has gone home.\u2019\nHe looked surprised, as though she were not accustomed to do anything without him; even to originate so slight a proceeding.\n\u2018I persuaded Miss Niner,\u2019 I explained.\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he. \u2018She is easily persuaded\u2014for her good. Thank you, Mr. Sampson; she is better within doors. The bathing-place was farther than I thought, to say the truth.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Niner is very delicate,\u2019 I observed.\nHe shook his head and drew a deep sigh. \u2018Very, very, very. You may recollect my saying so. The time that has since intervened has not strengthened her. The gloomy shadow that fell upon her sister so early in life seems, in my anxious eyes, to gather over her, ever darker, ever darker. Dear Margaret, dear Margaret! But we must hope.\u2019\nThe hand-carriage was spinning away before us at a most indecorous pace for an invalid vehicle, and was making most irregular curves upon the sand. Mr. Slinkton, noticing it after he had put his handkerchief to his eyes, said:\n\u2018If I may judge from appearances, your friend will be upset, Mr. Sampson.\u2019\n\u2018It looks probable, certainly,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018The servant must be drunk.\u2019\n\u2018The servants of old gentlemen will get drunk sometimes,\u2019 said I.\n\u2018The major draws very light, Mr. Sampson.\u2019\n\u2018The major does draw light,\u2019 said I.\nBy this time the carriage, much to my relief, was lost in the darkness. We walked on for a little, side by side over the sand, in silence. After a short while he said, in a voice still affected by the emotion that his niece\u2019s state of health had awakened in him,\n\u2018Do you stay here long, Mr. Sampson?\u2019\n\u2018Why, no. I am going away to-night.\u2019\n\u2018So soon? But business always holds you in request. Men like Mr. Sampson are too important to others, to be spared to their own need of relaxation and enjoyment.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know about that,\u2019 said I. \u2018However, I am going back.\u2019\n\u2018To London?\u2019\n\u2018To London.\u2019\n\u2018I shall be there too, soon after you.\u2019\nI knew that as well as he did. But I did not tell him so. Any more than I told him what defensive weapon my right hand rested on in my pocket, as I walked by his side. Any more than I told him why I did not walk on the sea side of him with the night closing in.\nWe left the beach, and our ways diverged. We exchanged good-night, and had parted indeed, when he said, returning,\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, may I ask? Poor Meltham, whom we spoke of,\u2014dead yet?\u2019\n\u2018Not when I last heard of him; but too broken a man to live long, and hopelessly lost to his old calling.\u2019\n\u2018Dear, dear, dear!\u2019 said he, with great feeling. \u2018Sad, sad, sad! The world is a grave!\u2019 And so went his way.\nIt was not his fault if the world were not a grave; but I did not call that observation after him, any more than I had mentioned those other things just now enumerated. He went his way, and I went mine with all expedition. This happened, as I have said, either at the end of September or beginning of October. The next time I saw him, and the last time, was late in November.\nV.\nI HAD a very particular engagement to breakfast in the Temple. It was a bitter north-easterly morning, and the sleet and slush lay inches deep in the streets. I could get no conveyance, and was soon wet to the knees; but I should have been true to that appointment, though I had to wade to it up to my neck in the same impediments.\nThe appointment took me to some chambers in the Temple. They were at the top of a lonely corner house overlooking the river. The name, Mr. Alfred Beckwith, was painted on the outer door. On the door opposite, on the same landing, the name Mr. Julius Slinkton. The doors of both sets of chambers stood open, so that anything said aloud in one set could be heard in the other.\nI had never been in those chambers before. They were dismal, close, unwholesome, and oppressive; the furniture, originally good, and not yet old, was faded and dirty,\u2014the rooms were in great disorder; there was a strong prevailing smell of opium, brandy, and tobacco; the grate and fire-irons were splashed all over with unsightly blotches of rust; and on a sofa by the fire, in the room where breakfast had been prepared, lay the host, Mr. Beckwith, a man with all the appearances of the worst kind of drunkard, very far advanced upon his shameful way to death.\n\u2018Slinkton is not come yet,\u2019 said this creature, staggering up when I went in; \u2018I\u2019ll call him.\u2014Halloa! Julius C\u00e6sar! Come and drink!\u2019 As he hoarsely roared this out, he beat the poker and tongs together in a mad way, as if that were his usual manner of summoning his associate.\nThe voice of Mr. Slinkton was heard through the clatter from the opposite side of the staircase, and he came in. He had not expected the pleasure of meeting me. I have seen several artful men brought to a stand, but I never saw a man so aghast as he was when his eyes rested on mine.\n\u2018Julius C\u00e6sar,\u2019 cried Beckwith, staggering between us, \u2018Mist\u2019 Sampson! Mist\u2019 Sampson, Julius C\u00e6sar! Julius, Mist\u2019 Sampson, is the friend of my soul. Julius keeps me plied with liquor, morning, noon, and night. Julius is a real benefactor. Julius threw the tea and coffee out of window when I used to have any. Julius empties all the water-jugs of their contents, and fills \u2019em with spirits. Julius winds me up and keeps me going.\u2014Boil the brandy, Julius!\u2019\nThere was a rusty and furred saucepan in the ashes,\u2014the ashes looked like the accumulation of weeks,\u2014and Beckwith, rolling and staggering between us as if he were going to plunge headlong into the fire, got the saucepan out, and tried to force it into Slinkton\u2019s hand.\n\u2018Boil the brandy, Julius C\u00e6sar! Come! Do your usual office. Boil the brandy!\u2019\nHe became so fierce in his gesticulations with the saucepan, that I expected to see him lay open Slinkton\u2019s head with it. I therefore put out my hand to check him. He reeled back to the sofa, and sat there panting, shaking, and red-eyed, in his rags of dressing-gown, looking at us both. I noticed then that there was nothing to drink on the table but brandy, and nothing to eat but salted herrings, and a hot, sickly, highly-peppered stew.\n\u2018At all events, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 said Slinkton, offering me the smooth gravel path for the last time, \u2018I thank you for interfering between me and this unfortunate man\u2019s violence. However you came here, Mr. Sampson, or with whatever motive you came here, at least I thank you for that.\u2019\n\u2018Boil the brandy,\u2019 muttered Beckwith.\nWithout gratifying his desire to know how I came there, I said, quietly, \u2018How is your niece, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019\nHe looked hard at me, and I looked hard at him.\n\u2018I am sorry to say, Mr. Sampson, that my niece has proved treacherous and ungrateful to her best friend. She left me without a word of notice or explanation. She was misled, no doubt, by some designing rascal. Perhaps you may have heard of it.\u2019\n\u2018I did hear that she was misled by a designing rascal. In fact, I have proof of it.\u2019\n\u2018Are you sure of that?\u2019 said he.\n\u2018Quite.\u2019\n\u2018Boil the brandy,\u2019 muttered Beckwith. \u2018Company to breakfast, Julius C\u00e6sar. Do your usual office,\u2014provide the usual breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper. Boil the brandy!\u2019\nThe eyes of Slinkton looked from him to me, and he said, after a moment\u2019s consideration,\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are a man of the world, and so am I. I will be plain with you.\u2019\n\u2018O no, you won\u2019t,\u2019 said I, shaking my head.\n\u2018I tell you, sir, I will be plain with you.\u2019\n\u2018And I tell you you will not,\u2019 said I. \u2018I know all about you. You plain with any one? Nonsense, nonsense!\u2019\n\u2018I plainly tell you, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he went on, with a manner almost composed, \u2018that I understand your object. You want to save your funds, and escape from your liabilities; these are old tricks of trade with you Office-gentlemen. But you will not do it, sir; you will not succeed. You have not an easy adversary to play against, when you play against me. We shall have to inquire, in due time, when and how Mr. Beckwith fell into his present habits. With that remark, sir, I put this poor creature, and his incoherent wanderings of speech, aside, and wish you a good morning and a better case next time.\u2019\nWhile he was saying this, Beckwith had filled a half-pint glass with brandy. At this moment, he threw the brandy at his face, and threw the glass after it. Slinkton put his hands up, half blinded with the spirit, and cut with the glass across the forehead. At the sound of the breakage, a fourth person came into the room, closed the door, and stood at it; he was a very quiet but very keen-looking man, with iron-gray hair, and slightly lame.\nSlinkton pulled out his handkerchief, assuaged the pain in his smarting eyes, and dabbled the blood on his forehead. He was a long time about it, and I saw that in the doing of it, a tremendous change came over him, occasioned by the change in Beckwith,\u2014who ceased to pant and tremble, sat upright, and never took his eyes off him. I never in my life saw a face in which abhorrence and determination were so forcibly painted as in Beckwith\u2019s then.\n\u2018Look at me, you villain,\u2019 said Beckwith, \u2018and see me as I really am. I took these rooms, to make them a trap for you. I came into them as a drunkard, to bait the trap for you. You fell into the trap, and you will never leave it alive. On the morning when you last went to Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, I had seen him first. Your plot has been known to both of us, all along, and you have been counter-plotted all along. What? Having been cajoled into putting that prize of two thousand pounds in your power, I was to be done to death with brandy, and, brandy not proving quick enough, with something quicker? Have I never seen you, when you thought my senses gone, pouring from your little bottle into my glass? Why, you Murderer and Forger, alone here with you in the dead of night, as I have so often been, I have had my hand upon the trigger of a pistol, twenty times, to blow your brains out!\u2019\nThis sudden starting up of the thing that he had supposed to be his imbecile victim into a determined man, with a settled resolution to hunt him down and be the death of him, mercilessly expressed from head to foot, was, in the first shock, too much for him. Without any figure of speech, he staggered under it. But there is no greater mistake than to suppose that a man who is a calculating criminal, is, in any phase of his guilt, otherwise than true to himself, and perfectly consistent with his whole character. Such a man commits murder, and murder is the natural culmination of his course; such a man has to outface murder, and will do it with hardihood and effrontery. It is a sort of fashion to express surprise that any notorious criminal, having such crime upon his conscience, can so brave it out. Do you think that if he had it on his conscience at all, or had a conscience to have it upon, he would ever have committed the crime?\nPerfectly consistent with himself, as I believe all such monsters to be, this Slinkton recovered himself, and showed a defiance that was sufficiently cold and quiet. He was white, he was haggard, he was changed; but only as a sharper who had played for a great stake and had been outwitted and had lost the game.\n\u2018Listen to me, you villain,\u2019 said Beckwith, \u2018and let every word you hear me say be a stab in your wicked heart. When I took these rooms, to throw myself in your way and lead you on to the scheme that I knew my appearance and supposed character and habits would suggest to such a devil, how did I know that? Because you were no stranger to me. I knew you well. And I knew you to be the cruel wretch who, for so much money, had killed one innocent girl while she trusted him implicitly, and who was by inches killing another.\u2019\nSlinkton took out a snuff-box, took a pinch of snuff, and laughed.\n\u2018But see here,\u2019 said Beckwith, never looking away, never raising his voice, never relaxing his face, never unclenching his hand. \u2018See what a dull wolf you have been, after all! The infatuated drunkard who never drank a fiftieth part of the liquor you plied him with, but poured it away, here, there, everywhere\u2014almost before your eyes; who bought over the fellow you set to watch him and to ply him, by outbidding you in his bribe, before he had been at his work three days\u2014with whom you have observed no caution, yet who was so bent on ridding the earth of you as a wild beast, that he would have defeated you if you had been ever so prudent\u2014that drunkard whom you have, many a time, left on the floor of this room, and who has even let you go out of it, alive and undeceived, when you have turned him over with your foot\u2014has, almost as often, on the same night, within an hour, within a few minutes, watched you awake, had his hand at your pillow when you were asleep, turned over your papers, taken samples from your bottles and packets of powder, changed their contents, rifled every secret of your life!\u2019\nHe had had another pinch of snuff in his hand, but had gradually let it drop from between his fingers to the floor; where he now smoothed it out with his foot, looking down at it the while.\n\u2018That drunkard,\u2019 said Beckwith, \u2018who had free access to your rooms at all times, that he might drink the strong drinks that you left in his way and be the sooner ended, holding no more terms with you than he would hold with a tiger, has had his master-key for all your locks, his test for all your poisons, his clue to your cipher-writing. He can tell you, as well as you can tell him, how long it took to complete that deed, what doses there were, what intervals, what signs of gradual decay upon mind and body; what distempered fancies were produced, what observable changes, what physical pain. He can tell you, as well as you can tell him, that all this was recorded day by day, as a lesson of experience for future service. He can tell you, better than you can tell him, where that journal is at this moment.\u2019\nSlinkton stopped the action of his foot, and looked at Beckwith.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said the latter, as if answering a question from him. \u2018Not in the drawer of the writing-desk that opens with a spring; it is not there, and it never will be there again.\u2019\n\u2018Then you are a thief!\u2019 said Slinkton.\nWithout any change whatever in the inflexible purpose, which it was quite terrific even to me to contemplate, and from the power of which I had always felt convinced it was impossible for this wretch to escape, Beckwith returned,\n\u2018And I am your niece\u2019s shadow, too.\u2019\nWith an imprecation Slinkton put his hand to his head, tore out some hair, and flung it to the ground. It was the end of the smooth walk; he destroyed it in the action, and it will soon be seen that his use for it was past.\nBeckwith went on: \u2018Whenever you left here, I left here. Although I understood that you found it necessary to pause in the completion of that purpose, to avert suspicion, still I watched you close, with the poor confiding girl. When I had the diary, and could read it word by word,\u2014it was only about the night before your last visit to Scarborough,\u2014you remember the night? you slept with a small flat vial tied to your wrist,\u2014I sent to Mr. Sampson, who was kept out of view. This is Mr. Sampson\u2019s trusty servant standing by the door. We three saved your niece among us.\u2019\nSlinkton looked at us all, took an uncertain step or two from the place where he had stood, returned to it, and glanced about him in a very curious way,\u2014as one of the meaner reptiles might, looking for a hole to hide in. I noticed at the same time, that a singular change took place in the figure of the man,\u2014as if it collapsed within his clothes, and they consequently became ill-shapen and ill-fitting.\n\u2018You shall know,\u2019 said Beckwith, \u2018for I hope the knowledge will be bitter and terrible to you, why you have been pursued by one man, and why, when the whole interest that Mr. Sampson represents would have expended any money in hunting you down, you have been tracked to death at a single individual\u2019s charge. I hear you have had the name of Meltham on your lips sometimes?\u2019\nI saw, in addition to those other changes, a sudden stoppage come upon his breathing.\n\u2018When you sent the sweet girl whom you murdered (you know with what artfully made-out surroundings and probabilities you sent her) to Meltham\u2019s office, before taking her abroad to originate the transaction that doomed her to the grave, it fell to Meltham\u2019s lot to see her and to speak with her. It did not fall to his lot to save her, though I know he would freely give his own life to have done it. He admired her;\u2014I would say he loved her deeply, if I thought it possible that you could understand the word. When she was sacrificed, he was thoroughly assured of your guilt. Having lost her, he had but one object left in life, and that was to avenge her and destroy you.\u2019\nI saw the villain\u2019s nostrils rise and fall convulsively; but I saw no moving at his mouth.\n\u2018That man Meltham,\u2019 Beckwith steadily pursued, \u2018was as absolutely certain that you could never elude him in this world, if he devoted himself to your destruction with his utmost fidelity and earnestness, and if he divided the sacred duty with no other duty in life, as he was certain that in achieving it he would be a poor instrument in the hands of Providence, and would do well before Heaven in striking you out from among living men. I am that man, and I thank God that I have done my work!\u2019\nIf Slinkton had been running for his life from swift-footed savages, a dozen miles, he could not have shown more emphatic signs of being oppressed at heart and labouring for breath, than he showed now, when he looked at the pursuer who had so relentlessly hunted him down.\n\u2018You never saw me under my right name before; you see me under my right name now. You shall see me once again in the body, when you are tried for your life. You shall see me once again in the spirit, when the cord is round your neck, and the crowd are crying against you!\u2019\nWhen Meltham had spoken these last words, the miscreant suddenly turned away his face, and seemed to strike his mouth with his open hand. At the same instant, the room was filled with a new and powerful odour, and, almost at the same instant, he broke into a crooked run, leap, start,\u2014I have no name for the spasm,\u2014and fell, with a dull weight that shook the heavy old doors and windows in their frames.\nThat was the fitting end of him.\nWhen we saw that he was dead, we drew away from the room, and Meltham, giving me his hand, said, with a weary air,\n\u2018I have no more work on earth, my friend. But I shall see her again elsewhere.\u2019\nIt was in vain that I tried to rally him. He might have saved her, he said; he had not saved her, and he reproached himself; he had lost her, and he was broken-hearted.\n\u2018The purpose that sustained me is over, Sampson, and there is nothing now to hold me to life. I am not fit for life; I am weak and spiritless; I have no hope and no object; my day is done.\u2019\nIn truth, I could hardly have believed that the broken man who then spoke to me was the man who had so strongly and so differently impressed me when his purpose was before him. I used such entreaties with him, as I could; but he still said, and always said, in a patient, undemonstrative way,\u2014nothing could avail him,\u2014he was broken-hearted.\nHe died early in the next spring. He was buried by the side of the poor young lady for whom he had cherished those tender and unhappy regrets; and he left all he had to her sister. She lived to be a happy wife and mother; she married my sister\u2019s son, who succeeded poor Meltham; she is living now, and her children ride about the garden on my walking-stick when I go to see her.\n"

                "content": "\n\u201cTalking of the prices of birds, I\u2019ve seen an ostrich that cost three hundred pounds,\u201d said the taxidermist, recalling his youth of travel. \u201cThree hundred pounds!\u201d\nHe looked at me over his spectacles. \u201cI\u2019ve seen another that was refused at four.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t any fancy points. They was just plain ostriches. A little off colour, too\u2014owing to dietary. And there wasn\u2019t any particular restriction of the demand either. You\u2019d have thought five ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. But the point was, one of \u2019em had swallowed a diamond.\n\u201cThe chap it got it off was Sir Mohini Padishah, a tremendous swell, a Piccadilly swell you might say up to the neck of him, and then an ugly black head and a whopping turban, with this diamond in it. The blessed bird pecked suddenly and had it, and when the chap made a fuss, it realised it had done wrong, I suppose, and went and mixed itself with the others to preserve its incog. It all happened in a minute. I was among the first to arrive, and there was this heathen going over his gods, and two sailors and the man who had charge of the birds laughing, fit to split. It was a rummy way of losing a jewel, come to think of it. The man in charge hadn\u2019t been about just at the moment, so that he didn\u2019t know which bird it was. Clean lost, you see. I didn\u2019t feel half sorry, to tell you the truth. The beggar had been swaggering over his blessed diamond ever since he came aboard.\n\u201cA thing like that goes from stem to stern of a ship in no time. Every one was talking about it. Padishah went below to hide his feelings. At dinner\u2014he pigged at a table by himself, him and two other Hindoos\u2014the captain kind of jeered at him about it, and he got very excited. He turned round and talked into my ear. He would not buy the birds; he would have his diamond. He demanded his rights as a British subject. His diamond must be found. He was firm upon that. He would appeal to the House of Lords. The man in charge of the birds was one of those wooden-headed chaps you can\u2019t get a new idea into anyhow. He refused any proposal to interfere with the birds by way of medicine. His instructions were to feed them so-and-so and treat them so-and-so, and it was as much as his place was worth not to feed them so-and-so and treat them so-and-so. Padishah had wanted a stomach-pump\u2014though you can\u2019t do that to a bird, you know. This Padishah was full of bad law, like most of these blessed Bengalis, and talked of having a lien on the birds, and so forth. But an old boy, who said his son was a London barrister, argued that what a bird swallowed became ipso facto part of the bird, and that Padishah\u2019s only remedy lay in an action for damages, and even then it might be possible to show contributory negligence. He hadn\u2019t any right of way about an ostrich that didn\u2019t belong to him. That upset Padishah extremely, the more so as most of us expressed an opinion that, that was the reasonable view. There wasn\u2019t any lawyer aboard to settle the matter, so we all talked pretty free. At last, after Aden, it appears that he came round to the general opinion, and went privately to the man in charge and made an offer for all five ostriches.\n\u201cThe next morning there was a fine shindy at breakfast. The man hadn\u2019t any authority to deal with the birds, and nothing on earth would induce him to sell; but it seems he told Padishah that a Eurasian named Potter had already made him an offer, and on that Padishah denounced Potter before us all. But I think the most of us thought it rather smart of Potter, and I know that when Potter said that he\u2019d wired at Aden to London to buy the birds, and would have an answer at Suez, I cursed pretty richly at a lost opportunity.\n\u201cAt Suez, Padishah gave way to tears\u2014actual wet tears\u2014when Potter became the owner of the birds, and offered him two hundred and fifty right off for the five, being more than two hundred percent on what Potter had given. Potter said he\u2019d be hanged if he parted with a feather of them\u2014that he meant to kill them off one by one and find the diamond; but afterwards, thinking it over, he relented a little. He was a gambling hound, was this Potter, a little queer at cards, and this kind of prize-packet business must have suited him down to the ground. Anyhow, he offered, for a lark, to sell the birds separately to separate people by auction at a starting price of L80 for a bird. But one of them, he said, he meant to keep for luck.\n\u201cYou must understand this diamond was a valuable one\u2014a little Jew chap, a diamond merchant, who was with us, had put it at three or four thousand when Padishah had shown it to him\u2014and this idea of an ostrich gamble caught on. Now it happened that I\u2019d been having a few talks on general subjects with the man who looked after these ostriches, and quite incidentally he\u2019d said one of the birds was ailing, and he fancied it had indigestion. It had one feather in its tail almost all white, by which I knew it, and so when, next day, the auction started with it, I capped Padishah\u2019s eighty-five by ninety. I fancy I was a bit too sure and eager with my bid, and some of the others spotted the fact that I was in the know. And Padishah went for that particular bird like an irresponsible lunatic. At last the Jew diamond merchant got it for \u00a3175, and Padishah said \u00a3180 just after the hammer came down\u2014so Potter declared. At any rate the Jew merchant secured it, and there and then he got a gun and shot it. Potter made a Hades of a fuss because he said it would injure the sale of the other three, and Padishah, of course, behaved like an idiot; but all of us were very much excited. I can tell you I was precious glad when that dissection was over, and no diamond had turned up\u2014precious glad. I\u2019d gone to one-forty on that particular bird myself.\n\u201cThe little Jew was like most Jews\u2014he didn\u2019t make any great fuss over bad luck; but Potter declined to go on with the auction until it was understood that the goods could not be delivered until the sale was over. The little Jew wanted to argue that the case was exceptional, and as the discussion ran pretty even, the thing was postponed until the next morning. We had a lively dinner-table that evening, I can tell you, but in the end Potter got his way, since it would stand to reason he would be safer if he stuck to all the birds, and that we owed him some consideration for his sportsmanlike behaviour. And the old gentleman whose son was a lawyer said he\u2019d been thinking the thing over and that it was very doubtful if, when a bird had been opened and the diamond recovered, it ought not to be handed back to the proper owner. I remember I suggested it came under the laws of treasure-trove\u2014which was really the truth of the matter. There was a hot argument, and we settled it was certainly foolish to kill the bird on board the ship. Then the old gentleman, going at large through his legal talk, tried to make out the sale was a lottery and illegal, and appealed to the captain; but Potter said he sold the birds as ostriches. He didn\u2019t want to sell any diamonds, he said, and didn\u2019t offer that as an inducement. The three birds he put up, to the best of his knowledge and belief, did not contain a diamond. It was in the one he kept\u2014so he hoped.\n\u201cPrices ruled high next day all the same. The fact that now there were four chances instead of five of course caused a rise. The blessed birds averaged \u00a3227, and, oddly enough, this Padishah didn\u2019t secure one of \u2019em\u2014not one. He made too much shindy, and when he ought to have been bidding he was talking about liens, and besides, Potter was a bit down on him. One fell to a quiet little officer chap, another to the little Jew, and the third was syndicated by the engineers. And then Potter seemed suddenly sorry for having sold them, and said he\u2019d flung away a clear thousand pounds, and that very likely he\u2019d draw a blank and that he always had been a fool, but when I went and had a bit of a talk to him, with the idea of getting him to hedge on his last chance, I found he\u2019d already sold the bird he\u2019d reserved to a political chap that was on board, a chap who\u2019d been studying Indian morals and social questions in his vacation. That last was the three hundred pounds bird. Well, they landed three of the blessed creatures at Brindisi\u2014though the old gentleman said it was a breach of the Customs regulations\u2014and Potter and Padishah landed too. The Hindoo seemed half mad as he saw his blessed diamond going this way and that, so to speak. He kept on saying he\u2019d get an injunction\u2014he had injunction on the brain\u2014and giving his name and address to the chaps who\u2019d bought the birds, so that they\u2019d know where to send the diamond. None of them wanted his name and address, and none of them would give their own. It was a fine row I can tell you\u2014on the platform. They all went off by different trains. I came on to Southampton, and there I saw the last of the birds, as I came ashore; it was the one the engineers bought, and it was standing up near the bridge, in a kind of crate, and looking as leggy and silly a setting for a valuable diamond as ever you saw\u2014if it was a setting for a valuable diamond.\n\u201cHow did it end? Oh! Like that. Well\u2014perhaps. Yes, there\u2019s one more thing that may throw light on it. A week or so after landing I was down Regent Street doing a bit of shopping, and who should I see arm-in-arm and having a purple time of it but Padishah and Potter. If you come to think of it\u2014\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve thought that. Only, you see, there\u2019s no doubt the diamond was real. And Padishah was an eminent Hindoo. I\u2019ve seen his name in the papers\u2014often. But whether the bird swallowed the diamond certainly is another matter, as you say.\u201d\n"

Then I told it again at the trial\u2013the whole thing absolutely as it happened, without so much as a word added. I set it all out truly, so help me God, all that Lady Mannering said and did, and then all that I had said and done, just as it occurred. And what did I get for it? \u201cThe prisoner put forward a rambling and inconsequential statement, incredible in its details, and unsupported by any shred of corroborative evidence.\u201d That was what one of the London papers said, and others let it pass as if I had made no defence at all. And yet, with my own eyes I saw Lord Mannering murdered, and I am as guiltless of it as any man on the jury that tried me.\nNow, sir, you are there to receive the petitions of prisoners. It all lies with you. All I ask is that you read it\u2013just read it\u2013and then that you make an inquiry or two about the private character of this \u201clady\u201d Mannering, if she still keeps the name that she had three years ago, when to my sorrow and ruin I came to meet her. You could use a private inquiry agent or a good lawyer, and you would soon learn enough to show you that my story is the true one. Think of the glory it would be to you to have all the papers saying that there would have been a shocking miscarriage of justice if it had not been for your perseverance and intelligence! That must be your reward, since I am a poor man and can offer you nothing. But if you don\u2019t do it, may you never lie easy in your bed again! May no night pass that you are not haunted by the thought of the man who rots in gaol because you have not done the duty which you are paid to do! But you will do it, sir, I know. Just make one or two inquiries, and you will soon find which way the wind blows. Remember, also, that the only person who profited by the crime was herself, since it changed her from an unhappy wife to a rich young widow. There\u2019s the end of the string in your hand, and you only have to follow it up and see where it leads to.\nMind you, sir, I make no complaint as far as the burglary goes. I don\u2019t whine about what I have deserved, and so far I have had no more than I have deserved. Burglary it was, right enough, and my three years have gone to pay for it. It was shown at the trial that I had had a hand in the Merton Cross business, and did a year for that, so my story had the less attention on that account. A man with a previous conviction never gets a really fair trial. I own to the burglary, but when it comes to the murder which brought me a lifer\u2013any judge but Sir James might have given me the gallows\u2013then I tell you that I had nothing to do with it, and that I am an innocent man. And now I\u2019ll take that night, the 13th of September, 1894, and I\u2019ll give you just exactly what occurred, and may God\u2019s hand strike me down if I go one inch over the truth.\nI had been at Bristol in the summer looking for work, and then I had a notion that I might get something at Portsmouth, for I was trained as a skilled mechanic, so I came tramping my way across the south of England, and doing odd jobs as I went. I was trying all I knew to keep off the cross, for I had done a year in Exeter Gaol, and I had had enough of visiting Queen Victoria. But it\u2019s cruel hard to get work when once the black mark is against your name, and it was all I could do to keep soul and body together. At last, after ten days of wood-cutting and stone-breaking on starvation pay, I found myself near Salisbury with a couple of shillings in my pocket, and my boots and my patience clean wore out. There\u2019s an alehouse called \u201cThe Willing Mind,\u201d which stands on the road between Blandford and Salisbury, and it was there that night I engaged a bed. I was sitting alone in the taproom just about closing time, when the inn-keeper\u2013Allen his name was\u2013came beside me and began yarning about the neighbours. He was a man that liked to talk and to have someone to listen to his talk, so I sat there smoking and drinking a mug of ale which he had stood me; and I took no great interest in what he said until he began to talk (as the devil would have it) about the riches of Mannering Hall.\n\u201cMeaning the large house on the right before I came to the village?\u201d said I. \u201cThe one that stands in its own park?\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said he\u2013and I am giving all our talk so that you may know that I am telling you the truth and hiding nothing. \u201cThe long white house with the pillars,\u201d said he. \u201cAt the side of the Blandford Road.\u201d\nNow I had looked at it as I passed, and it had crossed my mind, as such thoughts will, that it was a very easy house to get into with that great row of grand windows and glass doors. I had put the thought away from me, and now here was this landlord bringing it back with his talk about the riches within. I said nothing, but I listened, and as luck would have it, he would always come back to this one subject.\n\u201cHe was a miser young, so you can think what he is now in his age,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, he\u2019s had some good out of his money.\u201d\n\u201cWhat good can he have had if he does not spend it?\u201d said I.\n\u201cWell, it bought him the prettiest wife in England, and that was some good that he got out of it. She thought she would have the spending of it, but she knows the difference now.\u201d\n\u201cWho was she then?\u201d I asked, just for the sake of something to say.\n\u201cShe was nobody at all until the old Lord made her his Lady,\u201d said he. \u201cShe came from up London way, and some said that she had been on the stage there, but nobody knew. The old Lord was away for a year, and when he came home he brought a young wife back with him, and there she has been ever since. Stephens, the butler, did tell me once that she was the light of the house when fust she came, but what with her husband\u2019s mean and aggravatin\u2019 way, and what with her loneliness\u2013for he hates to see a visitor within his doors; and what with his bitter words\u2013for he has a tongue like a hornet\u2019s sting, her life all went out of her, and she became a white, silent creature, moping about the country lanes. Some say that she loved another man, and that it was just the riches of the old Lord which tempted her to be false to her lover, and that now she is eating her heart out because she has lost the one without being any nearer to the other, for she might be the poorest woman in the parish for all the money that she has the handling of.\u201d\nWell, sir, you can imagine that it did not interest me very much to hear about the quarrels between a Lord and a Lady. What did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice, or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit, and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants? The landlord told me of these things, and of many more like them, but they passed out of my mind, for they were no concern of mine. But what I did want to hear was the form in which Lord Mannering kept his riches. Title-deeds and stock certificates are but paper, and more danger than profit to the man who takes them. But metal and stones are worth a risk. And then, as if he were answering my very thoughts, the landlord told me of Lord Mannering\u2019s great collection of gold medals, that it was the most valuable in the world, and that it was reckoned that if they were put into a sack the strongest man in the parish would not be able to raise them. Then his wife called him, and he and I went to our beds.\nI am not arguing to make out a case for myself, but I beg you, sir, to bear all the facts in your mind, and to ask yourself whether a man could be more sorely tempted than I was. I make bold to say that there are few who could have held out against it. There I lay on my bed that night, a desperate man without hope or work, and with my last shilling in my pocket. I had tried to be honest, and honest folk had turned their backs upon me. They taunted me for theft; and yet they pushed me towards it. I was caught in the stream and could not get out. And then it was such a chance: the great house all lined with windows, the golden medals which could so easily be melted down. It was like putting a loaf before a starving man and expecting him not to eat it. I fought against it for a time, but it was no use. At last I sat up on the side of my bed, and I swore that that night I should either be a rich man and able to give up crime for ever, or that the irons should be on my wrists once more. Then I slipped on my clothes, and, having put a shilling on the table\u2013for the landlord had treated me well, and I did not wish to cheat him\u2013I passed out through the window into the garden of the inn.\nThere was a high wall round this garden, and I had a job to get over it, but once on the other side it was all plain sailing. I did not meet a soul upon the road, and the iron gate of the avenue was open. No one was moving at the lodge. The moon was shining, and I could see the great house glimmering white through an archway of trees. I walked up it for a quarter of a mile or so, until I was at the edge of the drive, where it ended in a broad, gravelled space before the main door. There I stood in the shadow and looked at the long building, with a full moon shining in every window and silvering the high stone front. I crouched there for some time, and I wondered where I should find the easiest entrance. The corner window of the side seemed to be the one which was least overlooked, and a screen of ivy hung heavily over it. My best chance was evidently there. I worked my way under the trees to the back of the house, and then crept along in the black shadow of the building. A dog barked and rattled his chain, but I stood waiting until he was quiet, and then I stole on once more until I came to the window which I had chosen.\nIt is astonishing how careless they are in the country, in places far removed from large towns, where the thought of burglars never enters their heads. I call it setting temptation in a poor man\u2019s way when he puts his hand, meaning no harm, upon a door, and finds it swing open before him. In this case it was not so bad as that, but the window was merely fastened with the ordinary catch, which I opened with a push from the blade of my knife. I pulled up the window as quickly as possible, then I thrust the knife through the slit in the shutter and prized it open. They were folding shutters, and I shoved them before me and walked into the room.\n\u201cGood evening, sir! You are very welcome!\u201d said a voice.\nI\u2019ve had some starts in my life, but never one to come up to that one. There, in the opening of the shutters, within reach of my arm, was standing a woman with a small coil of wax taper burning in her hand. She was tall and straight and slender, with a beautiful white face that might have been cut out of clear marble, but her hair and eyes were as black as night. She was dressed in some sort of white dressing-gown which flowed down to her feet, and what with this robe and what with her face, it seemed as if a spirit from above was standing in front of me. My knees knocked together, and I held on to the shutter with one hand to give me support. I should have turned and run away if I had had the strength, but I could only just stand and stare at her.\nShe soon brought me back to myself once more.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened!\u201d said she, and they were strange words for the mistress of a house to have to use to a burglar. \u201cI saw you out of my bedroom window when you were hiding under those trees, so I slipped downstairs, and then I heard you at the window. I should have opened it for you if you had waited, but you managed it yourself just as I came up.\u201d\nI still held in my hand the long clasp-knife with which I had opened the shutter. I was unshaven and grimed from a week on the roads. Altogether, there are few people who would have cared to face me alone at one in the morning; but this woman, if I had been her lover meeting her by appointment, could not have looked upon me with a more welcoming eye. She laid her hand upon my sleeve and drew me into the room.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this, ma\u2019am? Don\u2019t get trying any little games upon me,\u201d said I, in my roughest way\u2013and I can put it on rough when I like. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the worse for you if you play me any trick,\u201d I added, showing her my knife.\n\u201cI will play you no trick,\u201d said she. \u201cOn the contrary, I am your friend, and I wish to help you.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but I find it hard to believe that,\u201d said I. \u201cWhy should you wish to help me?\u201d\n\u201cI have my own reasons,\u201d said she; and then suddenly, with those black eyes blazing out of her white face: \u201cIt\u2019s because I hate him, hate him, hate him! Now you understand.\u201d\nI remembered what the landlord had told me, and I did understand. I looked at her Ladyship\u2019s face, and I knew that I could trust her. She wanted to revenge herself upon her husband. She wanted to hit him where it would hurt him most\u2013upon the pocket. She hated him so that she would even lower her pride to take such a man as me into her confidence if she could gain her end by doing so. I\u2019ve hated some folk in my time, but I don\u2019t think I ever understood what hate was until I saw that woman\u2019s face in the light of the taper.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll trust me now?\u201d said she, with another coaxing touch upon my sleeve.\n\u201cYes, your Ladyship.\u201d\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\n\u201cI can guess who you are.\u201d\n\u201cI dare say my wrongs are the talk of the county. But what does he care for that? He only cares for one thing in the whole world, and that you can take from him this night. Have you a bag?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your Ladyship.\u201d\n\u201cShut the shutter behind you. Then no one can see the light. You are quite safe. The servants all sleep in the other wing. I can show you where all the most valuable things are. You cannot carry them all, so we must pick the best.\u201d\nThe room in which I found myself was long and low, with many rugs and skins scattered about on a polished wood floor. Small cases stood here and there, and the walls were decorated with spears and swords and paddles, and other things which find their way into museums. There were some queer clothes, too, which had been brought from savage countries, and the lady took down a large leather sack-bag from among them.\n\u201cThis sleeping-sack will do,\u201d said she. \u201cNow come with me and I will show you where the medals are.\u201d\nIt was like a dream to me to think that this tall, white woman was the lady of the house, and that she was lending me a hand to rob her own home. I could have burst out laughing at the thought of it, and yet there was something in that pale face of hers which stopped my laughter and turned me cold and serious. She swept on in front of me like a spirit, with the green taper in her hand, and I walked behind with my sack until we came to a door at the end of this museum. It was locked, but the key was in it, and she led me through.\nThe room beyond was a small one, hung all round with curtains which had pictures on them. It was the hunting of a deer that was painted on it, as I remember, and in the flicker of that light you\u2019d have sworn that the dogs and the horses were streaming round the walls. The only other thing in the room was a row of cases made of walnut, with brass ornaments. They had glass tops, and beneath this glass I saw the long lines of those gold medals, some of them as big as a plate and half an inch thick, all resting upon red velvet and glowing and gleaming in the darkness. My fingers were just itching to be at them, and I slipped my knife under the lock of one of the cases to wrench it open.\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said she, laying her hand upon my arm. \u201cYou might do better than this.\u201d\n\u201cI am very well satisfied, ma\u2019am,\u201d said I, \u201cand much obliged to your Ladyship for kind assistance.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do better,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWould not golden sovereigns be worth more to you than these things?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said I. \u201cThat\u2019s best of all.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said she. \u201cHe sleeps just above our head. It is but one short staircase. There is a tin box with money enough to fill this bag under his bed.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I get it without waking him?\u201d\n\u201cWhat matter if he does wake?\u201d She looked very hard at me as she spoke. \u201cYou could keep him from calling out.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll have none of that.\u201d\n\u201cJust as you like,\u201d said she. \u201cI thought that you were a stout-hearted sort of man by your appearance, but I see that I made a mistake. If you are afraid to run the risk of one old man, then of course you cannot have the gold which is under his bed. You are the best judge of your own business, but I should think that you would do better at some other trade.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll not have murder on my conscience.\u201d\n\u201cYou could overpower him without harming him. I never said anything about murder. The money lies under the bed. But if you are faint-hearted, it is better that you should not attempt it.\u201d\nShe worked upon me so, partly with her scorn and partly with this money that she held before my eyes, that I believe I should have yielded and taken my chances upstairs, had it not been that I saw her eyes following the struggle within me in such a crafty, malignant fashion, that it was evident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge, and that she would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to be captured by him. She felt suddenly that she was giving herself away, and she changed her face to a kindly, friendly smile, but it was too late, for I had had my warning.\n\u201cI will not go upstairs,\u201d said I. \u201cI have all I want here.\u201d\nShe looked her contempt at me, and there never was a face which could look it plainer.\n\u201cVery good. You can take these medals. I should be glad if you would begin at this end. I suppose they will all be the same value when melted down, but these are the ones which are the rarest, and therefore, the most precious to him. It is not necessary to break the locks. If you press that brass knob you will find that there is a secret spring. So! Take that small one first\u2013it is the very apple of his eye.\u201d\nShe had opened one of the cases, and the beautiful things all lay exposed before me. I had my hand upon the one which she had pointed out, when suddenly a change came over her face, and she held up one finger as a warning. \u201cHist!\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nFar away in the silence of the house we heard a low, dragging, shuffling sound, and the distant tread of feet. She closed and fastened the case in an instant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my husband!\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll right. Don\u2019t be alarmed. I\u2019ll arrange it. Here! Quick, behind the tapestry!\u201d\nShe pushed me behind the painted curtains upon the wall, my empty leather bag still in my hand. Then she took her taper and walked quickly into the room from which we had come. From where I stood I could see her through the open door.\n\u201cIs that you, Robert?\u201d she cried.\nThe light of a candle shone through the door of the museum, and the shuffling steps came nearer. Then I saw a face in the doorway, a great, heavy face, all lines and creases, with a huge curving nose, and a pair of gold glasses fixed across it. He had to throw his head back to see through the glasses, and that great nose thrust out in front of him like the beak of some sort of fowl. He was a big man, very tall and burly, so that in his loose dressing-gown his figure seemed to fill up the whole doorway. He had a pile of grey, curling hair all round his head, but his face was clean-shaven. His mouth was thin and small and prim, hidden away under his long, masterful nose. He stood there, holding the candle in front of him, and looking at his wife with a queer, malicious gleam in his eyes. It only needed that one look to tell me that he was as fond of her as she was of him.\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d he asked. \u201cSome new tantrum? What do you mean by wandering about the house? Why don\u2019t you go to bed?\u201d\n\u201cI could not sleep,\u201d she answered. She spoke languidly and wearily. If she was an actress once, she had not forgotten her calling.\n\u201cMight I suggest,\u201d said he, in the same mocking kind of voice, \u201cthat a good conscience is an excellent aid to sleep?\u201d\n\u201cThat cannot be true,\u201d she answered, \u201cfor you sleep very well.\u201d\n\u201cI have only one thing in my life to be ashamed of,\u201d said he, and his hair bristled up with anger until he looked like an old cockatoo. \u201cYou know best what that is. It is a mistake which has brought its own punishment with it.\u201d\n\u201cTo me as well as to you. Remember that!\u201d\n\u201cYou have very little to whine about. It was I who stooped and you who rose.\u201d\n\u201cRose!\u201d\n\u201cYes, rose. I suppose you do not deny that it is a promotion to exchange the music-hall for Mannering Hall. Fool that I was ever to take you out of your true sphere!\u201d\n\u201cIf you think so, why do you not separate?\u201d\n\u201cBecause private misery is better than public humiliation. Because it is easier to suffer for a mistake than to own to it. Because also I like to keep you in my sight, and to know that you cannot go back to him.\u201d\n\u201cYou villain! You cowardly villain!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, my lady. I know your secret ambition, but it shall never be while I live, and if it happens after my death I will at least take care that you go to him as a beggar. You and dear Edward will never have the satisfaction of squandering my savings, and you may make up your mind to that, my lady. Why are those shutters and the window open?\u201d\n\u201cI found the night very close.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not safe. How do you know that some tramp may not be outside? Are you aware that my collection of medals is worth more than any similar collection in the world? You have left the door open also. What is there to prevent any one from rifling the cases?\u201d\n\u201cI was here.\u201d\n\u201cI know you were. I heard you moving about in the medal room, and that was why I came down. What were you doing?\u201d\n\u201cLooking at the medals. What else should I be doing?\u201d\n\u201cThis curiosity is something new.\u201d He looked suspiciously at her and moved on towards the inner room, she walking beside him.\nIt was at this moment that I saw something which startled. I had laid my clasp-knife open upon the top of one of the cases, and there it lay in full view. She saw it before he did, and with a woman\u2019s cunning she held her taper out so that the light of it came between Lord Mannering\u2019s eyes and the knife. Then she took it with her left hand and held it against her gown out of his sight. He looked about from case to case\u2013I could have put my hand at one time upon his long nose\u2013but there was nothing to show that the medals had been tampered with, and so, still snarling and grumbling, he shuffled off into the other room once more.\nAnd now I have to speak of what I heard rather than of what I saw, but I swear to you, as I shall stand some day before my Maker, that what I say is the truth.\nWhen they passed into the outer room I saw him lay his candle upon the corner of one of the tables, and he sat himself down, but in such a position that he was just out of my sight. She moved behind him, as I could tell from the fact that the light of her taper threw his long, lumpy shadow upon the floor in front of him. Then he began talking about this man whom he called Edward, and every word that he said was like a blistering drop of vitriol. He spoke low, so that I could not hear it all, but from what I heard I should guess that she would as soon have been lashed with a whip. At first she said some hot words in reply, but then she was silent, and he went on and on in that cold, mocking voice of his, nagging and insulting and tormenting, until I wondered that she could bear to stand there in silence and listen to it. Then suddenly I heard him say in a sharp voice, \u201cCome from behind me! Leave go of my collar! What! would you dare to strike me?\u201d There was a sound like a blow, just a soft sort of thud, and then I heard him cry out, \u201cMy God, it\u2019s blood!\u201d He shuffled with his feet as if he was getting up, and then I heard another blow, and he cried out, \u201cOh, you she-devil!\u201d and was quiet, except for a dripping and splashing upon the floor.\nI ran out from behind my curtain at that, and rushed into the other room, shaking all over with the horror of it. The old man had slipped down in the chair, and his dressing-gown had rucked up until he looked as if he had a monstrous hump to his back. His head, with the gold glasses still fixed on his nose, was lolling over upon one side, and his little mouth was open just like a dead fish. I could not see where the blood was coming from, but I could still hear it drumming upon the floor. She stood behind him with the candle shining full upon her face. Her lips were pressed together and her eyes shining, and a touch of colour had come into each of her cheeks. It just wanted that to make her the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my life.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now!\u201d said I.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said she, in her quiet way, \u201cI\u2019ve done it now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey\u2019ll have you for murder as sure as fate.\u201d\n\u201cNever fear about me. I have nothing to live for, and it does not matter. Give me a hand to set him straight in the chair. It is horrible to see him like this!\u201d\nI did so, though it turned me cold all over to touch him. Some of his blood came on my hand and sickened me.\n\u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cyou may as well have the medals as anyone else. Take them and go.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them. I only want to get away. I was never mixed up with a business like this before.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said she. \u201cYou came for the medals, and here they are at your mercy. Why should you not have them? There is no one to prevent you.\u201d\nI held the bag still in my hand. She opened the case, and between us we threw a hundred or so of the medals into it. They were all from the one case, but I could not bring myself to wait for any more. Then I made for the window, for the very air of this house seemed to poison me after what I had seen and heard. As I looked back, I saw her standing there, tall and graceful, with the light in her hand just as I had seen her first. She waved good-bye, and I waved back at her and sprang out into the gravel drive.\nI thank God that I can lay my hand upon my heart and say that I have never done a murder, but perhaps it would be different if I had been able to read that woman\u2019s mind and thoughts. There might have been two bodies in the room instead of one if I could have seen behind that last smile of hers. But I thought of nothing but of getting safely away, and it never entered my head how she might be fixing the rope round my neck. I had not taken five steps out from the window skirting down the shadow of the house in the way that I had come, when I heard a scream that might have raised the parish, and then another and another.\n\u201cMurder!\u201d she cried. \u201cMurder! Murder! Help!\u201d and her voice rang out in the quiet of the night-time and sounded over the whole country-side. It went through my head, that dreadful cry. In an instant lights began to move and windows to fly up, not only in the house behind me, but at the lodge and in the stables in front. Like a frightened rabbit I bolted down the drive, but I heard the clang of the gate being shut before I could reach it. Then I hid my bag of medals under some dry fagots, and I tried to get away across the park, but someone saw me in the moonlight, and presently I had half a dozen of them with dogs upon my heels. I crouched down among the brambles, but those dogs were too many for me, and I was glad enough when the men came up and prevented me from being torn into pieces. They seized me, and dragged me back to the room from which I had come.\n\u201cIs this the man, your Ladyship?\u201d asked the oldest of them\u2013the same whom I found out afterwards to be the butler.\nShe had been bending over the body, with her handkerchief to her eyes, and now she turned upon me with the face of a fury. Oh, what an actress that woman was!\n\u201cYes, yes, it is the very man,\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, you villain, you cruel villain, to treat an old man so!\u201d\nThere was a man there who seemed to be a village constable. He laid his hand upon my shoulder.\n\u201cWhat do you say to that?\u201d said he.\n\u201cIt was she who did it,\u201d I cried, pointing at the woman, whose eyes never flinched before mine.\n\u201cCome! come! Try another!\u201d said the constable, and one of the men-servants struck at me with his fist.\n\u201cI tell you that I saw her do it. She stabbed him twice with a knife. She first helped me to rob him, and then she murdered him.\u201d\nThe footman tried to strike me again, but she held up her hand.\n\u201cDo not hurt him,\u201d said she. \u201cI think that his punishment may safely be left to the law.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see to that, your Ladyship,\u201d said the constable. \u201cYour Ladyship actually saw the crime committed, did you not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I saw it with my own eyes. It was horrible. We heard the noise and we came down. My poor husband was in front. The man had one of the cases open, and was filling a black leather bag which he held in his hand. He rushed past us, and my husband seized him. There was a struggle, and he stabbed him twice. There you can see the blood upon his hands. If I am not mistaken, his knife is still in Lord Mannering\u2019s body.\u201d\n\u201cLook at the blood upon her hands!\u201d I cried.\n\u201cShe has been holding up his Lordship\u2019s head, you lying rascal,\u201d said the butler.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the very sack her Ladyship spoke of,\u201d said the constable, as a groom came in with the one which I had dropped in my flight. \u201cAnd here are the medals inside it. That\u2019s good enough for me. We will keep him safe here to-night, and to-morrow the inspector and I can take him into Salisbury.\u201d\n\u201cPoor creature,\u201d said the woman. \u201cFor my own part, I forgive him any injury which he has done me. Who knows what temptation may have driven him to crime? His conscience and the law will give him punishment enough without any reproach of mine rendering it more bitter.\u201d\nI could not answer\u2013I tell you, sir, I could not answer, so taken aback was I by the assurance of the woman. And so, seeming by my silence to agree to all that she had said, I was dragged away by the butler and the constable into the cellar, in which they locked me for the night.\nThere, sir, I have told you the whole story of the events which led up to the murder of Lord Mannering by his wife upon the night of September the 14th, in the year 1894. Perhaps you will put my statement on one side as the constable did at Mannering Towers, or the judge afterwards at the county assizes. Or perhaps you will see that there is the ring of truth in what I say, and you will follow it up, and so make your name for ever as a man who does not grudge personal trouble where justice is to be done. I have only you to look to, sir, and if you will clear my name of this false accusation, then I will worship you as one man never yet worshipped another. But if you fail me, then I give you my solemn promise that I will rope myself up, this day month, to the bar of my window, and from that time on I will come to plague you in your dreams if ever yet one man was able to come back and to haunt another. What I ask you to do is very simple. Make inquiries about this woman, watch her, learn her past history, find out what she is making of the money which has come to her, and whether there is not a man Edward as I have stated. If from all this you learn anything which shows you her real character, or which seems to you to corroborate the story which I have told you, then I am sure that I can rely upon your goodness of heart to come to the rescue of an innocent man.\n"

                "content": "\nSome business had detained me in Chancery Lane, until nine in the evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was disinclined either for entertainment or further work. So much of the sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left visible, spoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the variegated lights upon the river. Beyond comparison the night is the best time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the waters, and the lights of this transitional age, red glaring orange, gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, warm grey against the starlight. The black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its surface.\n\u201cA warm night,\u201d said a voice at my side.\nI turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the parapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him.\nI looked at him curiously. Would he have anything to tell me worth the money, or was he the common incapable\u2014incapable even of telling his own story? There was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me.\n\u201cVery warm,\u201d said I; \u201cbut not too warm for us here.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, still looking across the water, \u201cit is pleasant enough here...just now.\n\u201cIt is good,\u201d he continued after a pause, \u201cto find anything so restful as this in London. After one has been fretting about business all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, I do not know what one would do if it were not for such pacific corners.\u201d He spoke with long pauses between the sentences. \u201cYou must know a little of the irksome labour of the world, or you would not be here. But I doubt if you can be so brain-weary and footsore as I am...Bah! Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle. I feel inclined to throw the whole thing over\u2014name, wealth and position\u2014and take to some modest trade. But I know if I abandoned my ambition\u2014hardly as she uses me\u2014I should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my days.\u201d\nHe became silent. I looked at him in astonishment. If ever I saw a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left in a dust-bin for a week. And he was talking to me of the irksome worries of a large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty.\n\u201cIf high aims and high positions,\u201d said I, \u201chave their drawbacks of hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. Influence, the power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than ourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in display.\u201d\nMy banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste. I spoke on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech. I was sorry even while I was speaking.\nHe turned a haggard but very composed face upon me. Said he: \u201cI forgot myself. Of course you would not understand.\u201d\nHe measured me for a moment. \u201cNo doubt it is very absurd. You will not believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to tell you. And it will be a comfort to tell someone. I really have a big business in hand, a very big business. But there are troubles just now. The fact is...I make diamonds.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said I, \u201cyou are out of work just at present?\u201d\n\u201cI am sick of being disbelieved,\u201d he said impatiently, and suddenly unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown pebble. \u201cI wonder if you know enough, to know what that is?\u201d He handed it to me.\nNow, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a London science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and mineralogy. The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though far too large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb. I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the curved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals. I took out my penknife and tried to scratch it\u2014vainly. Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that, with the greatest ease.\nI looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity. \u201cIt certainly is rather like a diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cI tell you I made it,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it back to me.\u201d\nHe replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket. \u201cI will sell it to you for one hundred pounds,\u201d he suddenly whispered eagerly. With that my suspicions returned. The thing might, after all, be merely a lump of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond. Or if it was a diamond, how came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds?\nWe looked into one another\u2019s eyes. He seemed eager, but honestly eager. At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell. Yet I am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only. Still, a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds. Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without being mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind the stories of contraband and light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. I put the question of purchase on one side.\n\u201cHow did you get it?\u201d said I.\n\u201cI made it.\u201d\nI had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds were very small. I shook my head.\n\u201cYou seem to know something of this kind of thing. I will tell you a little about myself. Perhaps then you may think better of the purchase.\u201d He turned round with his back to the river, and put his hands in his pockets. He sighed. \u201cI know you will not believe me.\u201d\n\u201cDiamonds,\u201d he began\u2014and as he spoke his voice lost its faint flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated man\u2014\u201care to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon crystallises out, not as black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small diamonds. So much has been known to chemists for years, but no one yet had hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up the carbon, or exactly the right pressure for the best results. Consequently the diamonds made by chemists are small and dark, and worthless as jewels. Now I, you know, have given up my life to this problem\u2014given my life to it.\u201d\n\u201cI began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was seventeen, and now I am thirty-two. It seemed to me that it might take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty years, but, even if it did, the game was still worth the candle. Suppose one to have at last just hit the right trick before the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal, one might realize millions. Millions!\u201d\nHe paused and looked for my sympathy. His eyes shone hungrily. \u201cTo think,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am on the verge of it all, and here!\n\u201cI had,\u201d he proceeded, \u201cabout a thousand pounds when I was twenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would keep my researches going. A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy. You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been sure of coming in first, in the case of a race for the discovery. And you see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money simply flowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances. I tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education except in chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three years ago I settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and heating.\u201d\nHe paused.\n\u201cRather risky,\u201d said I.\n\u201cYes. It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my apparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. Following out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some researches of Daubree\u2019s at the Paris Laboratorie des Poudres et Salpetres. He exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong to burst, and I found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike the South African bed in which diamonds are found. It was a tremendous strain on my resources, but I got a steel cylinder made for my purpose after his pattern. I put in all my stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my furnace, put the whole concern in, and\u2014went out for a walk.\u201d\nI could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner. \u201cDid you not think it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the place?\u201d\n\u201cIt was in the interest of science,\u201d he said, ultimately. \u201cThere was a costermonger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in the room behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs. Perhaps it was a bit thoughtless. But possibly some of them were out.\n\u201cWhen I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the white-hot coals. The explosive hadn\u2019t burst the case. And then I had a problem to face. You know time is an important element in crystallisation. If you hurry the process the crystals are small\u2014it is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any size. I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years, letting the temperature go down slowly during the time. And I was now quite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room, as well as my hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world.\n\u201cI can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making the diamonds. I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors. For many weeks I addressed envelopes. I had a place as assistant to a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the road while he called down the other.\n\u201cOnce for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged. What a week that was! One day the fire was going out and I had eaten nothing all day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave me sixpence\u2014to show-off. Thank heaven for vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went and spent it all on coals, and had the furnace bright red again, and then\u2014Well, hunger makes a fool of a man.\n\u201cAt last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out. I took my cylinder and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, and I scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate. And I found three big diamonds and five small ones. As I sat on the floor hammering, my door opened, and my neighbour, the begging-letter writer came in. He was drunk\u2014as he usually is, \u2018Nerchist,\u2019 said he. \u2018You\u2019re drunk,\u2019 said I. \u2018Structive scoundrel,\u2019 said he. \u2018Go to your father,\u2019 said I, meaning the Father of Lies. \u2018Never you mind,\u2019 said he, and gave me a cunning wink, and hiccupped, and leaning up against the door, with his other eye against the doorpost, began to babble of how he had been prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that morning, and how they had taken down everything he had to say\u2014\u2019siffiwas a ge\u2019m,\u2019 said he. Then I suddenly realised I was in a hole. Either I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get the whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist. So I went up to my neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him about a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out. The evening newspapers called my den the Kentish-Town Bomb Factory. And now I cannot part with the things for love or money.\n\u201cIf I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait. And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going about now with several hundred thousand pounds-worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or shelter. You are the first person I have taken into my confidence. But I like your face and I am hard-driven.\u201d\nHe looked into my eyes.\n\u201cIt would be madness,\u201d said I, \u201cfor me to buy a diamond under the circumstances. Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my pocket. Yet I more than half believe your story. I will, if you like, do this: come to my office to-morrow...\u201d\n\u201cYou think I am a thief!\u201d said he keenly. \u201cYou will tell the police. I am not coming into a trap.\u201d\n\u201cSomehow I am assured you are no thief. Here is my card. Take that, anyhow. You need not come to any appointment. Come when you will.\u201d\nHe took the card, and an earnest of my good-will.\n\u201cThink better of it and come,\u201d said I.\nHe shook his head doubtfully. \u201cI will pay back your half-crown with interest some day\u2014such interest as will amaze you,\u201d said he. \u201cAnyhow, you will keep the secret...? Don\u2019t follow me.\u201d\nHe crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go. And that was the last I ever saw of him.\nAfterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send bank-notes\u2014not cheques\u2014to certain addresses. I weighed the matter over and took what I conceived to be the wisest course. Once he called upon me when I was out. My urchin described him as a very thin, dirty, and ragged man, with a dreadful cough. He left no message. That was the finish of him so far as my story goes. I wonder sometimes what has become of him. Was he an ingenious monomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really made diamonds as he asserted? The latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at times that I have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life. He may of course be dead, and his diamonds carelessly thrown aside\u2014one, I repeat, was almost as big as my thumb. Or he may be still wandering about trying to sell the things. It is just possible he may yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the well-advertised, reproach me silently for my want of enterprise. I sometimes think I might at least have risked five pounds.\n"

In the darkness, the senseless pain. In the pain, the nightmare.\nHe was not unconscious.\nYour name? asked hidden voices. Sale, he replied in whirling nausea. Leonard Sale. Occupation, cried the voices. Spaceman! he cried, alone in the night. Welcome, said the voices. Welcome, welcome. They faded.\nHe stood up in the wreckage of his ship. It lay like a folded, tattered garment around him.\nThe sun rose and it was morning.\nSale pried himself out the small air-lock and stood breathing the atmosphere. Luck. Sheer luck. The air was breathable. An instant\u2019s checking showed him that he had two month\u2019s supply of food with him. Fine, fine! And this\u2014he fingered at the wreckage. Miracle of miracles! The radio was intact.\nHe stuttered out the message on the sending key. CRASHED ON PLANETOID 787. SALE. SEND HELP. SALE. SEND HELP.\nThe reply came instantly: HELLO, SALE. THIS IS ADDAMS IN MARSPORT. SENDING RESCUE SHIP LOGARITHM. WILL ARRIVE PLANETOID 787 IN SIX DAYS. HANG ON.\nSale did a little dance.\nIt was simple as that. One crashed. One had food. One radioed for help. Help came. La! He clapped his hands.\nThe sun rose and was warm. He felt no sense of mortality. Six days would be no time at all. He would eat, he would read, he would sleep. He glanced at his surroundings. No dangerous animals; a tolerable oxygen supply. What more could one ask. Beans and bacon, was the answer. The happy smell of breakfast filled the air.\nAfter breakfast he smoked a cigarette slowly, deeply, blowing out. He nodded contentedly. What a life! Not a scratch on him. Luck. Sheer luck.\nHis head nodded. Sleep, he thought.\nGood idea. Forty winks. Plenty of time to sleep, take it easy. Six whole long, luxurious days of idling and philosophizing. Sleep.\nHe stretched himself out, tucked his arm under his head, and shut his eyes.\n \nInsanity came in to take him. The voices whispered.\nSleep, yes, sleep, said the voices. Ah, sleep, sleep.\nHe opened his eyes. The voices stopped. Everything was normal. He shrugged. He shut his eyes casually, fitfully. He settled his long body.\nEeeeeeeeeeee, sang the voices, far away.\nAhhhhhhhh, sang the voices.\nSleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sang the voices.\nDie, die, die, die, die, sang the voices.\nOoooooooooooooo, cried the voices.\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, a bee ran through his brain.\nHe sat up. He shook his head. He put his hands to his ears. He blinked at the crashed ship. Hard metal. He felt the solid rock under his fingers. He saw the real sun warming the blue sky.\nLet\u2019s try sleeping on our back, he thought. He adjusted himself, lying back down. His watch ticked on his wrist. The blood burned in his veins.\nSleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sang the voices.\nOhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sang the voices.\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sang the voices.\nDie, die, die, die, die. Sleep, sleep, die, sleep, die, sleep, die! Oohhh. Ahhhhh. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nBlood tapped in his ears. The sound of the wind rising.\nMine, mine, said a voice.

His eyelids jerked.\nAt last, at last, sang a high voice. Now, now. The long time, the waiting. Over, over, sang the high voice. Over, over at last!\nIt was like being undersea. Green songs, green visions, green time. Bubbled voices drowning in deep liquors of sea tide. Far away choruses chanting senseless rhymes. Leonard Sale stirred in agony.\nMine, mine, cried a loud voice. Mine, mine! shrieked another. Ours, ours! shrieked the chorus.\nThe din of metal, the crash of sword, the conflict, the battle, the fight, the war. All of it exploding, his mind fiercely torn apart!\nEeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nHe leaped up, screaming. The landscape melted and flowed.\n \nA voice said, \u201cI am Tylle of Rathalar. Proud Tylle, Tylle of the Blood Mound and the Death Drum.

He was trembling so violently he could not stand. Insane, he thought. Absolutely insane. Raving insane. Insane.\nHe jerked the food kit open, did something to a chemical packet. Hot coffee was ready in an instant. He mouthed it, spilled gushes of it down his shirt. He shivered. He sucked in raw gulps of breath.\nLet\u2019s be logical, he thought, sitting down heavily. The coffee seared his tongue. No record of insanity in the family for two hundred years. All healthy, well-balanced. No reason for insanity now. Shock? Silly. No shock. I\u2019m to be rescued in six days. No shock to that. No danger. Just an ordinary planetoid. Ordinary, ordinary place. No reason for insanity. I\u2019m sane.\nOh? cried a small metal voice within. An echo. Fading.\n\u201cYes!\u201d he cried, beating his fists together. \u201cSane!\u201d\nHahahahahahahahahah. Somewhere a vanishing laughter.\nHe whirled about. \u201cShut up, you!\u201d he cried.\nWe didn\u2019t say anything, said the mountains. We didn\u2019t say anything, said the sky. We didn\u2019t say anything, said the wreckage.\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d he said, swaying. \u201cSee that you don\u2019t.\u201d\nEverything was normal.\n \nThe pebbles were getting hot. The sky was big and blue. He looked at his fingers and saw the way the sun burned on every black hair. He looked at his boots and the dust on them. Suddenly he felt very happy because he made a decision. I won\u2019t go to sleep, he thought. I\u2019m having nightmares, so why sleep. There\u2019s your solution.\nHe made a routine. From nine o\u2019clock in the morning, which was this minute, until twelve, he would walk around and see the planetoid. He would write on a pad with a yellow pencil everything he saw. Then he would sit down and open a can of oily sardines and some canned fresh bread with good butter on it. From twelve thirty until four he would read nine chapters of War and Peace. He took the book from the wreckage, and laid it where he might find it later. There was a book of T. S. Eliot\u2019s poetry, too. That might be nice.\nSupper would come at five-thirty and then from six until ten he would listen to the radio from Earth. There would be a couple of bad comedians telling jokes and a bad singer singing some song, and the latest news flashes, signing off at midnight with the UN anthem.\nAfter that?\nHe felt sick.\nI\u2019ll play solitaire until dawn, he thought. I\u2019ll sit up and drink hot black coffee and play solitaire, no cheating, until sunrise.\nHo ho, he thought.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked himself.\n\u201cI said \u2018Ha ha\u2019,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome time, you\u2019ll have to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m wide awake,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLiar,\u201d he retorted, enjoying the conversation.\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHypocrite,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the night, or sleep, or anything,\u201d he said.\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d he said.\nHe felt bad. He wanted to sleep. And the fact that he was afraid of sleep made him want to lie down all the more and shut his eyes and curl up. \u201cComfy-cozy?\u201d asked his ironic censor.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just walk and look at the rocks and the geological formations and think how good it is to be alive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYe gods,\u201d cried his censor. \u201cWilliam Saroyan!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll go on, he thought, maybe one day, maybe one night, but what about the next night and the next, and the next? Can you stay awake all that time, for six nights? Until the rescue ship comes? Are you that good, that strong?\nThe answer was no.\nWhat are you afraid of? I don\u2019t know. Those voices. Those sounds. But they can\u2019t hurt you, can they?\nThey might. You\u2019ve got to face them some time. Must I? Brace up to it, old man. Chin up, and all that rot.\nHe sat down on the hard ground. He felt very much like crying. He felt as if life was over and he was entering new and unknown territory. It was such a deceiving day, with the sun warm; physically, he felt able and well, one might fish on such a day as this, or pick flowers or kiss a woman or anything. But in the midst of a lovely day, what did one get?\nDeath.\nWell, hardly that.\nDeath, he insisted.\nHe lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired of messing around.\nAll right, he thought, if you are death, come get me. I want to know what all this damned nonsense is about.\nDeath came.\n \nEeeeeeeeeeeeee, said a voice.\nYes, I know, said Leonard Sale, lying there. But what else?\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, said a voice.\nI know that, also, said Leonard Sale, irritably. He turned cold. His mouth hung open wildly.\n\u201cI am Tylle of Rathalar, Killer of Men!\u201d\n\u201cI am Iorr of Wendillo, Destroyer of Infidels!\u201d\nWhat is this place? asked Leonard Sale, struggling against horror.\n\u201cOnce a mighty planet!\u201d said Tylle of Rathalar.\n\u201cOnce a place of battles!\u201d said Iorr of Wendillo.\n\u201cNow dead,\u201d said Tylle.\n\u201cNow silent,\u201d said Iorr.\n\u201cUntil you came,\u201d said Tylle.\n\u201cTo give us life again,\u201d said Iorr.\nYou\u2019re dead, insisted Leonard Sale, flesh writhing. You\u2019re nothing but empty wind.\n\u201cWe live, through you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd fight, through you!\u201d\nSo that\u2019s it, thought Leonard Sale. I\u2019m to be a battleground, am I? Are you friends?\n\u201cEnemies!\u201d cried Iorr.\n\u201cFoul enemies!\u201d cried Tylle.\n \nLeonard smiled a rictal smile. He felt ghastly. How long have you waited? he demanded.\n\u201cHow long is time?\u201d Ten thousand years? \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Ten million years? \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\nWhat are you? Thoughts, spirits, ghosts? \u201cAll of those, and more.\u201d Intelligences? \u201cPrecisely.\u201d How did you survive?\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, sang the chorus, far away.\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sang another army, waiting to fight.\n\u201cOnce upon a time, this was fertile land, a rich planet. And there were two nations, strong nations, led by two strong men. I, Iorr. And he, that one who calls himself Tylle. And the planet declined and gave way to nothingness. The peoples and the armies languished in the midst of a great war which had lasted five thousand years. We lived long lives and loved long loves, drank much, slept much, fought much. And when the planet died, our bodies withered, and, only in time, and with much science, did we survive.\u201d\nSurvive, wondered Leonard Sale. But there is nothing of you!\n\u201cOur minds, fool, our minds! What is a body without a mind?\u201d\nWhat is a mind without a body, laughed Leonard Sale. I\u2019ve got you there. Admit it, I\u2019ve got you!\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said the cruel voice. \u201cOne is useless lacking the other. But survival is survival even when unconscious. The minds of our nations, through science, through wonder, survived.\u201d\nBut without senses, lacking eyes, ears, lacking touch, smell, and the rest? \u201cLacking all those, yes. We were vapors, merely. For a long time. Until today.\u201d\nAnd now I am here, thought Leonard Sale. \u201cYou are here,\u201d said the voice. \u201cTo give substance to our mentalities. To give us our needed body.\u201d\nI\u2019m only one, thought Sale. \u201cNevertheless, you are of use.\u201d\nI\u2019m an individual, thought Sale. I resent your intrusion.\n\u201cHe resents our intrusion! Did you hear him, Iorr? He resents!\u201d\n\u201cAs if he had a right to resent!\u201d\nBe careful, warned Sale. I\u2019ll blink my eyes and you\u2019ll be gone, phantoms! I\u2019ll wake up and rub you out!\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll have to sleep again, some time!\u201d cried Iorr. \u201cAnd when you do, we\u2019ll be here, waiting, waiting, waiting. For you.\u201d\nWhat do you want? \u201cSolidity. Mass. Sensation again.\u201d You can\u2019t both have it. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight that out between us.\u201d\nA hot clamp twisted his skull. It was as if a spike had been thrust and beaten down between the bivalvular halves of his brain.\nNow it was terribly clear. Horribly, magnificently clear. He was their universe. The world of his thoughts, his brain, his skull, divided into two camps, that of Iorr, that of Tylle. They were using him!\nPennants flung up on a pink mind sky! Brass shields caught the sun. Grey animals shifted and came rushing in bristling tides of sword and plume and trumpet.\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! The rushing.\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! The roaring.\nNowwwwwwwwww! the whirling.\nMmmmmmmmmmmmm\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTen thousand men hurtled across the small hidden stage. Ten thousand men floated on the shellacked inner ball of his eye. Ten thousand javelins hissed between the small bone hulls of his head. Ten thousand jeweled guns exploded. Ten thousand voices chanted in his ears. Now his body was riven and extended, shaken and rolled, he was screaming, writhing, the plates of his skull threatened to burst asunder. The gabbling, the shrilling, as, across bone plains of mind and continent of inner marrow, through gullies of vein, down hills of artery, over rivers of melancholy, came armies and armies, one army, two armies, swords flashed in the sun, bearing down upon each other, fifty thousand minds snatching, scrabbling, cutting at him, demanding, using. In a moment, the hard collision, one army on another, the rush, the blood, the sound, the fury, the death, the insanity!\nLike cymbals, the armies struck!\nHe leaped up, raving. He ran across the desert. He ran and ran and did not stop running.\nHe sat down and cried. He sobbed until his lungs ached. He cried very hard and long. Tears ran down his cheeks and into his upraised, trembling fingers. \u201cGod, God, help me, oh God, help me,\u201d he said.\nAll was normal again.\n \nIt was four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. The rocks were baked by the sun. He managed, after a time, to cook himself a few hot biscuits, which he ate with strawberry jam. He wiped his stained fingers on his shirt, blindly, trying not to think.\n\u201cAt least I know what I\u2019m up against,\u201d he thought. \u201cOh, Lord, what a world. What an innocent looking world, and what a monster it really is. It\u2019s good no one ever explored it before. Or did they?\u201d He shook his aching head. Pity them, who ever crashed here before, if any ever did. Warm sun, hard rocks, not a sign of hostility. A lovely world.\nUntil you shut your eyes and relaxed your mind.\nAnd the night and the voices and the insanity and the death padded in on soft feet.\n\u201cI\u2019m all right now, though,\u201d he said, proudly. \u201cLook at that.\u201d He displayed his hand. By a supreme effort of will, it was no longer shaking. \u201cI\u2019ll show you who in hell\u2019s ruler here,\u201d he announced to the innocent sky. \u201cI am.\u201d He tapped his chest.\nTo think that thought could live that long! A million years, perhaps, all these thoughts of death and disorder and conquest, lingering in the innocent but poisonous air of the planet, waiting for a real man to give them a channel through which they might issue again in all their senseless virulence.\nNow that he was feeling better, it was all silly. All I have to do, he thought, is stay awake six nights. They won\u2019t bother me that way. When I\u2019m awake, I\u2019m dominant. I\u2019m stronger than those crazy monarchs and their silly tribes of sword-flingers and shield-bearers and horn-blowers. I\u2019ll stay awake.\nBut can you? he wondered. Six whole nights? Awake?\nThere\u2019s coffee and medicine and books and cards.\nBut I\u2019m tired now, so tired, he thought. Can I hold out?\nWell, if not. There\u2019s always the gun.\nWhere will these silly monarchs be if you put a bullet through their stage? All the world\u2019s a stage? No. You, Leonard Sale, are the small stage. And they the players. And what if you put a bullet through the wings, tearing down scenes, destroying curtains, ruining lines! Destroy the stage, the players, all, if they aren\u2019t careful!\nFirst of all, he must radio through to Marsport, again. If there was any way they could rush the rescue ship sooner, then maybe he could hang on. Anyway, he must warn them what sort of planet this was, this so innocent seeming spot of nightmare and fever vision\u2014\nHe tapped on the radio key for a minute. His mouth tightened. The radio was dead.\nIt had sent through the proper rescue message, received a reply, and then extinguished itself.\nThe proper touch of irony, he thought. There was only one thing to do. Draw a plan.\nThis he did. He got a yellow pencil and delineated his six day plan of escape.\nTonight, he wrote, read six more chapters of War and Peace. At four in the morning have hot black coffee. At four-fifteen take cards from pack and play ten games of solitaire. This should take until six-thirty when\u2014more coffee. At seven o\u2019clock, listen to early morning programs from Earth, if the receiving equipment on the radio works at all. Does it?\nHe tried the radio receiver. It was dead.\nWell, he wrote, from seven o\u2019clock until eight, sing all the songs you remember, make your own entertainment. From eight until nine think about Helen King. Remember Helen. On second thought, think about Helen right now.\n \nHe marked that out with his pencil.\nThe rest of the days were set down in minute detail.\nHe checked the medical kit. There were several packets of tablets that would keep you awake. One tablet an hour every hour for six days. He felt quite confident.\n\u201cHere\u2019s mud in your evil eye, Iorr, Tylle!\u201d\nHe swallowed one of the stay-wake tablets with a scalding mouth of black coffee.\n \nWell, with one thing and another it was Tolstoy or Balzac, gin-rummy, coffee, tablets, walking, more Tolstoy, more Balzac, more gin-rummy, more solitaire. The first day passed, as did the second and the third.\nOn the fourth day he lay quietly in the shade of a rock, counting to a thousand by fives, then by tens, to keep his mind occupied and awake. His eyes were so tired he had to bathe them frequently in cool water. He couldn\u2019t read, he was bothered with splitting headaches. He was so exhausted he couldn\u2019t move. He was numb with medicine. He resembled a waxen dummy, stuffed with things to preserve him in a state of horrified wakefulness. His eyes were glass, his tongue a rusted pike, his fingers felt as if they were gloved in needles and fur.\nHe followed the hand of his watch. One second less to wait, he thought. Two seconds, three seconds, four, five, ten, thirty seconds. A whole minute. Now an hour less time to wait. Oh, ship, hurry on thy appointed round!\nHe began to laugh softly.\nWhat would happen if he just gave up, drifted off into sleep? Sleep, ah, sleep; perchance to dream. All the world a stage.... What if he gave up the unequal struggle, lapsed down?\nEeeeeeeeeee, the high, shrill warning sound of battle metal.\nHe shivered. His tongue moved in his dry, burry mouth.\nIorr and Tylle would battle out their ancient battle.\nLeonard Sale would become quite insane.\nAnd whichever won the battle, would take this ruin of an insane man, the shaking, laughing wild body, and wander it across the face of this world for ten, twenty years, occupying it, striding in it, pompous, holding court, making grand gestures, ordering heads severed, calling on inward unseen dancing girls. Leonard Sale, what remained of him, would be led off to some hidden cave, there to be infested with wars and worms of wars for twenty insane years, occupied and prostituted by old and outlandish thoughts.\nWhen the rescue ship arrived it would find nothing. Sale would be hidden somewhere by a triumphant army in his head. Hidden in some cleft of rock, placed there like a nest for Iorr to lie upon in evil occupation.\nThe thought of it almost broke him in half.\nTwenty years of insanity. Twenty years of torture, doing what you don\u2019t want to do. Twenty years of wars raging and being split apart, twenty years of nausea and trembling.\nHis head sank down between his knees. His eyes snapped and cracked and made soft noises. His eardrum popped tiredly.\nSleep, sleep, sang soft sea voices.\nI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll make a proposition with you, listen, thought Leonard Sale. You, Iorr, you, too, Tylle! Iorr, you can occupy me on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Tylle, you can take me over on Sundays, Tuesdays and Saturdays. Thursday is maid\u2019s night out. Okay?\nEeeeeeeeeeeeee, sang the sea tides, seething in his brain.\nOhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sang the distant voices softly, soft.\nWhat\u2019ll you say, is it a bargain, Iorr, Tylle?\nNo, said a voice.\nNo, said another.\nGreedy, both of you, greedy! complained Sale. A pox on both your houses!\nHe slept.\n \nHe was Iorr, jeweled rings on his hands. He arose beside his rocket and held out his fingers, commanding blind armies. He was Iorr, ancient ruler of jeweled warriors.\nHe was Tylle, lover of women, killer of dogs!\nWith some hidden bit of awareness, his hand crept to the holster at his hip. The sleeping hand withdrew the gun there. The hand lifted, the gun pointed.\nThe armies of Tylle and Iorr gave battle.\nThe gun exploded.\nThe bullet tore across Sale\u2019s forehead, wakening him.\nHe stayed awake for another six hours, getting over his latest siege. He knew it to be hopeless now. He washed and bandaged the wound he had given himself. He wished he had aimed straighter and it was all over. He watched the sky. Two more days. Two more. Come on, ship, come on. He was heavy with sleeplessness.\nNo use. At the end of six hours he was raving badly. He took the gun up and put it down and took it up again, put it against his head, tightened his hand on the trigger, changed his mind, looked at the sky again.\nNight settled. He tried to read, threw the book away. He tore it up and burned it, just to have something to do.\nSo tired. In another hour, he decided. If nothing happens, I\u2019ll kill myself. This is for certain now. I\u2019ll do it, this time.\nHe got the gun ready and laid it on the ground next to himself.\nHe was very calm now, though tired. It would be over and done. He would be dead.\nHe watched the minute hand of his watch. One minute, five minutes, twenty-five minutes.\nThe flame appeared on the sky.\nIt was so unbelievable he started to cry. \u201cA rocket,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cA rocket!\u201d he cried, rubbing his eyes. He ran forward.\nThe flame brightened, grew, came down.\nHe waved frantically, running forward, leaving his gun, his supplies, everything behind. \u201cYou see that, Iorr, Tylle! You savages, you monsters, I beat you! I won! They\u2019re coming to rescue me now! I\u2019ve won, damn you.\u201d\nHe laughed harshly at the rocks and the sky and the backs of his hands.\nThe rocket landed. Leonard Sale stood swaying, waiting for the door to lid open.\n\u201cGoodbye, Iorr, goodbye, Tylle!\u201d he shouted in triumph, grinning, eyes hot.\nEeeeee, sang a diminishing roar in time.\nAhhhhhh, voices faded.\nThe rocket flipped wide its air-lock. Two men jumped out.\n\u201cSale?\u201d they called. \u201cWe\u2019re Ship ACDN13. Intercepted your SOS and decided to pick you up ourselves. The Marsport ship won\u2019t get through until day after tomorrow. We want a spot of rest ourselves. Thought it\u2019d be good to spend the night here, pick you up, and go on.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sale, face melting with terror. \u201cNo spend night\u2014\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t talk. He fell to the ground.\n\u201cQuick,\u201d said a voice, in the bleary vortex over him. \u201cGive him a shot of food liquid, another of sedative. He needs sustenance and rest.\u201d\n\u201cNo rest!\u201d screamed Sale.\n\u201cDelirious,\u201d said one man softly.\n\u201cNo sleep!\u201d screamed Sale.\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said the man gently. A needle poked into Sale\u2019s arm.\nSale thrashed. \u201cNo sleep, go!\u201d he mouthed horribly. \u201cOh, go!\u201d\n\u201cDelirious,\u201d said one man. \u201cShock.\u201d\n\u201cNo sedative!\u201d screamed Sale.\nThe sedative flowed into him.\nEeeeeeeeeeee, sang the ancient winds.\nAhhhhhhhhhhhh, sang the ancient seas.\n\u201cNo sedative, no sleep, please, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201d screamed Sale, trying to get up. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014understand!\u201d\n\u201cTake it easy, old man, you\u2019re safe among us now, nothing to worry about,\u201d said the rescuer above him.\nLeonard Sale slept. The two men stood over him.\nAs they watched, Sale\u2019s features changed violently. He groaned and cried and snarled in his sleep. His face was riven with emotion. It was the face of a saint, a sinner, a fiend, a monster, a darkness, a light, one, many, an army, a vacuum, all, all!\nHe writhed in his sleep.\nEeeeeeeeee! the sound burst from his mouth. Ahhhhhhhhhhh! he screamed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d asked one of the two rescuers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. More sedative?\u201d\n\u201cMore sedative. Nerves. He needs more sleep.\u201d\nThey stuck the needle in his arm. Sale writhed and spat and moaned.\nThen, suddenly, he was dead.\nHe lay there, the two men over him. \u201cWhat a shame,\u201d said one of them. \u201cCan you figure that?\u201d\n\u201cShock. Poor guy. What a pity.\u201d They covered his face. \u201cDid you ever see a face like that?\u201d\n\u201cTotally insane.\u201d\n\u201cLoneliness. Shock.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Lord, what an expression. I hope never to see a face like that again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame, waiting for us, and we arrive, and he dies anyway.\u201d\nThey glanced around. \u201cWhat shall we do? Shall we spend the night?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s good to be out of the ship.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll bury him first, of course.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd spend the night in the open, with good air, right? Good to be in the open again. After two weeks in that damned ship.\u201d\n\u201cRight. I\u2019ll find a spot for him. You start supper, eh?\u201d\n\u201cDone.\u201d\n\u201cShould be good sleeping tonight.\u201d\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d\nThey made a grave and said a word over it. They drank their evening coffee silently. They smelled the sweet air of the planet and looked at the lovely sky and the bright and beautiful stars.\n\u201cWhat a night,\u201d they said, lying down.\n\u201cPleasant dreams,\u201d said one, rolling over.\nAnd the other replied, \u201cPleasant dreams.\u201d\nThey slept\n"

                "content": "\nIn 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier\u2014restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which to-day we should call indigence than impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meagre comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of \u201cimprovement\u201d\u2014a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man\u2019s zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \u201cchinking\u201d of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up\u2014nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant\u2019s dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living to-day who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.\nThe man\u2019s name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lustreless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders\u2014a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man\u2019s story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story\u2014excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter\u2014that supplied by my grandfather.\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm\u2014the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support\u2014he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man\u2019s widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep\u2014surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. \u201cTo-morrow,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cI shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now\u2014she is dead, of course, but it is all right\u2014it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\u201d\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right\u2014that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for (and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture) no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table\u2019s edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening wood! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened\u2014he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see\u2014he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who\u2014what had waked him, and where was it?\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step\u2014another\u2014sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited\u2014waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman\u2019s name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal\u2019s ear.\n"

                "content": "\nEvery night in the year, four of us sat in the small parlour of the George at Debenham\u2014the undertaker, and the landlord, and Fettes, and myself. Sometimes there would be more; but blow high, blow low, come rain or snow or frost, we four would be each planted in his own particular arm-chair. Fettes was an old drunken Scotchman, a man of education obviously, and a man of some property, since he lived in idleness. He had come to Debenham years ago, while still young, and by a mere continuance of living had grown to be an adopted townsman. His blue camlet cloak was a local antiquity, like the church-spire. His place in the parlour at the George, his absence from church, his old, crapulous, disreputable vices, were all things of course in Debenham. He had some vague Radical opinions and some fleeting infidelities, which he would now and again set forth and emphasise with tottering slaps upon the table. He drank rum\u2014five glasses regularly every evening; and for the greater portion of his nightly visit to the George sat, with his glass in his right hand, in a state of melancholy alcoholic saturation. We called him the Doctor, for he was supposed to have some special knowledge of medicine, and had been known, upon a pinch, to set a fracture or reduce a dislocation; but beyond these slight particulars, we had no knowledge of his character and antecedents.\nOne dark winter night\u2014it had struck nine some time before the landlord joined us\u2014there was a sick man in the George, a great neighbouring proprietor suddenly struck down with apoplexy on his way to Parliament; and the great man\u2019s still greater London doctor had been telegraphed to his bedside. It was the first time that such a thing had happened in Debenham, for the railway was but newly open, and we were all proportionately moved by the occurrence.\n\u2018He\u2019s come,\u2019 said the landlord, after he had filled and lighted his pipe.\n\u2018He?\u2019 said I. \u2018Who?\u2014not the doctor?\u2019\n\u2018Himself,\u2019 replied our host.\n\u2018What is his name?\u2019\n\u2018Doctor Macfarlane,\u2019 said the landlord.\nFettes was far through his third tumbler, stupidly fuddled, now nodding over, now staring mazily around him; but at the last word he seemed to awaken, and repeated the name \u2018Macfarlane\u2019 twice, quietly enough the first time, but with sudden emotion at the second.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the landlord, \u2018that\u2019s his name, Doctor Wolfe Macfarlane.\u2019\nFettes became instantly sober; his eyes awoke, his voice became clear, loud, and steady, his language forcible and earnest. We were all startled by the transformation, as if a man had risen from the dead.\n\u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am afraid I have not been paying much attention to your talk. Who is this Wolfe Macfarlane?\u2019 And then, when he had heard the landlord out, \u2018It cannot be, it cannot be,\u2019 he added; \u2018and yet I would like well to see him face to face.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know him, Doctor?\u2019 asked the undertaker, with a gasp.\n\u2018God forbid!\u2019 was the reply. \u2018And yet the name is a strange one; it were too much to fancy two. Tell me, landlord, is he old?\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said the host, \u2018he\u2019s not a young man, to be sure, and his hair is white; but he looks younger than you.\u2019\n\u2018He is older, though; years older. But,\u2019 with a slap upon the table, \u2018it\u2019s the rum you see in my face\u2014rum and sin. This man, perhaps, may have an easy conscience and a good digestion. Conscience! Hear me speak. You would think I was some good, old, decent Christian, would you not? But no, not I; I never canted. Voltaire might have canted if he\u2019d stood in my shoes; but the brains\u2019\u2014with a rattling fillip on his bald head\u2014\u2018the brains were clear and active, and I saw and made no deductions.\u2019\n\u2018If you know this doctor,\u2019 I ventured to remark, after a somewhat awful pause, \u2018I should gather that you do not share the landlord\u2019s good opinion.\u2019\nFettes paid no regard to me.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, with sudden decision, \u2018I must see him face to face.\u2019\nThere was another pause, and then a door was closed rather sharply on the first floor, and a step was heard upon the stair.\n\u2018That\u2019s the doctor,\u2019 cried the landlord. \u2018Look sharp, and you can catch him.\u2019\nIt was but two steps from the small parlour to the door of the old George Inn; the wide oak staircase landed almost in the street; there was room for a Turkey rug and nothing more between the threshold and the last round of the descent; but this little space was every evening brilliantly lit up, not only by the light upon the stair and the great signal-lamp below the sign, but by the warm radiance of the bar-room window. The George thus brightly advertised itself to passers-by in the cold street. Fettes walked steadily to the spot, and we, who were hanging behind, beheld the two men meet, as one of them had phrased it, face to face. Dr. Macfarlane was alert and vigorous. His white hair set off his pale and placid, although energetic, countenance. He was richly dressed in the finest of broadcloth and the whitest of linen, with a great gold watch-chain, and studs and spectacles of the same precious material. He wore a broad-folded tie, white and speckled with lilac, and he carried on his arm a comfortable driving-coat of fur. There was no doubt but he became his years, breathing, as he did, of wealth and consideration; and it was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot\u2014bald, dirty, pimpled, and robed in his old camlet cloak\u2014confront him at the bottom of the stairs.\n\u2018Macfarlane!\u2019 he said somewhat loudly, more like a herald than a friend.\nThe great doctor pulled up short on the fourth step, as though the familiarity of the address surprised and somewhat shocked his dignity.\n\u2018Toddy Macfarlane!\u2019 repeated Fettes.\nThe London man almost staggered. He stared for the swiftest of seconds at the man before him, glanced behind him with a sort of scare, and then in a startled whisper, \u2018Fettes!\u2019 he said, \u2018You!\u2019\n\u2018Ay,\u2019 said the other, \u2018me! Did you think I was dead too? We are not so easy shut of our acquaintance.\u2019\n\u2018Hush, hush!\u2019 exclaimed the doctor. \u2018Hush, hush! this meeting is so unexpected\u2014I can see you are unmanned. I hardly knew you, I confess, at first; but I am overjoyed\u2014overjoyed to have this opportunity. For the present it must be how-d\u2019ye-do and good-bye in one, for my fly is waiting, and I must not fail the train; but you shall\u2014let me see\u2014yes\u2014you shall give me your address, and you can count on early news of me. We must do something for you, Fettes. I fear you are out at elbows; but we must see to that for auld lang syne, as once we sang at suppers.\u2019\n\u2018Money!\u2019 cried Fettes; \u2018money from you! The money that I had from you is lying where I cast it in the rain.\u2019\nDr. Macfarlane had talked himself into some measure of superiority and confidence, but the uncommon energy of this refusal cast him back into his first confusion.\nA horrible, ugly look came and went across his almost venerable countenance. \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 he said, \u2018be it as you please; my last thought is to offend you. I would intrude on none. I will leave you my address, however\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I do not wish it\u2014I do not wish to know the roof that shelters you,\u2019 interrupted the other. \u2018I heard your name; I feared it might be you; I wished to know if, after all, there were a God; I know now that there is none. Begone!\u2019\nHe still stood in the middle of the rug, between the stair and doorway; and the great London physician, in order to escape, would be forced to step to one side. It was plain that he hesitated before the thought of this humiliation. White as he was, there was a dangerous glitter in his spectacles; but while he still paused uncertain, he became aware that the driver of his fly was peering in from the street at this unusual scene and caught a glimpse at the same time of our little body from the parlour, huddled by the corner of the bar. The presence of so many witnesses decided him at once to flee. He crouched together, brushing on the wainscot, and made a dart like a serpent, striking for the door. But his tribulation was not yet entirely at an end, for even as he was passing Fettes clutched him by the arm and these words came in a whisper, and yet painfully distinct, \u2018Have you seen it again?\u2019\nThe great rich London doctor cried out aloud with a sharp, throttling cry; he dashed his questioner across the open space, and, with his hands over his head, fled out of the door like a detected thief. Before it had occurred to one of us to make a movement the fly was already rattling toward the station. The scene was over like a dream, but the dream had left proofs and traces of its passage. Next day the servant found the fine gold spectacles broken on the threshold, and that very night we were all standing breathless by the bar-room window, and Fettes at our side, sober, pale, and resolute in look.\n\u2018God protect us, Mr. Fettes!\u2019 said the landlord, coming first into possession of his customary senses. \u2018What in the universe is all this? These are strange things you have been saying.\u2019\nFettes turned toward us; he looked us each in succession in the face. \u2018See if you can hold your tongues,\u2019 said he. \u2018That man Macfarlane is not safe to cross; those that have done so already have repented it too late.\u2019\nAnd then, without so much as finishing his third glass, far less waiting for the other two, he bade us good-bye and went forth, under the lamp of the hotel, into the black night.\nWe three turned to our places in the parlour, with the big red fire and four clear candles; and as we recapitulated what had passed, the first chill of our surprise soon changed into a glow of curiosity. We sat late; it was the latest session I have known in the old George. Each man, before we parted, had his theory that he was bound to prove; and none of us had any nearer business in this world than to track out the past of our condemned companion, and surprise the secret that he shared with the great London doctor. It is no great boast, but I believe I was a better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the George; and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to you the following foul and unnatural events.\nIn his young days Fettes studied medicine in the schools of Edinburgh. He had talent of a kind, the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears and readily retails it for its own. He worked little at home; but he was civil, attentive, and intelligent in the presence of his masters. They soon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well; nay, strange as it seemed to me when I first heard it, he was in those days well favoured, and pleased by his exterior. There was, at that period, a certain extramural teacher of anatomy, whom I shall here designate by the letter K. His name was subsequently too well known. The man who bore it skulked through the streets of Edinburgh in disguise, while the mob that applauded at the execution of Burke called loudly for the blood of his employer. But Mr. K\u2014 was then at the top of his vogue; he enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address, partly to the incapacity of his rival, the university professor. The students, at least, swore by his name, and Fettes believed himself, and was believed by others, to have laid the foundations of success when he had acquired the favour of this meteorically famous man. Mr. K\u2014 was a bon vivant as well as an accomplished teacher; he liked a sly illusion no less than a careful preparation. In both capacities Fettes enjoyed and deserved his notice, and by the second year of his attendance he held the half-regular position of second demonstrator or sub-assistant in his class.\nIn this capacity the charge of the theatre and lecture-room devolved in particular upon his shoulders. He had to answer for the cleanliness of the premises and the conduct of the other students, and it was a part of his duty to supply, receive, and divide the various subjects. It was with a view to this last\u2014at that time very delicate\u2014affair that he was lodged by Mr. K\u2014 in the same wynd, and at last in the same building, with the dissecting-rooms. Here, after a night of turbulent pleasures, his hand still tottering, his sight still misty and confused, he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table. He would open the door to these men, since infamous throughout the land. He would help them with their tragic burden, pay them their sordid price, and remain alone, when they were gone, with the unfriendly relics of humanity. From such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber, to repair the abuses of the night, and refresh himself for the labours of the day.\nFew lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality. His mind was closed against all general considerations. He was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another, the slave of his own desires and low ambitions. Cold, light, and selfish in the last resort, he had that modicum of prudence, miscalled morality, which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft. He coveted, besides, a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellow-pupils, and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life. Thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies, and day after day rendered unimpeachable eye-service to his employer, Mr. K\u2014. For his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring, blackguardly enjoyment; and when that balance had been struck, the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content.\nThe supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master. In that large and busy class, the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out; and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself, but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned. It was the policy of Mr. K\u2014 to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade. \u2018They bring the body, and we pay the price,\u2019 he used to say, dwelling on the alliteration\u2014\u2018quid pro quo.\u2019 And, again, and somewhat profanely, \u2018Ask no questions,\u2019 he would tell his assistants, \u2018for conscience\u2019 sake.\u2019 There was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder. Had that idea been broached to him in words, he would have recoiled in horror; but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was, in itself, an offence against good manners, and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt. Fettes, for instance, had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies. He had been struck again and again by the hang-dog, abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn; and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts, he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master. He understood his duty, in short, to have three branches: to take what was brought, to pay the price, and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime.\nOne November morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test. He had been awake all night with a racking toothache\u2014pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed\u2014and had fallen at last into that profound, uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain, when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal. There was a thin, bright moonshine; it was bitter cold, windy, and frosty; the town had not yet awakened, but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day. The ghouls had come later than usual, and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone. Fettes, sick with sleep, lighted them upstairs. He heard their grumbling Irish voices through a dream; and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing, with his shoulder propped against the wall; he had to shake himself to find the men their money. As he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face. He started; he took two steps nearer, with the candle raised.\n\u2018God Almighty!\u2019 he cried. \u2018That is Jane Galbraith!\u2019\nThe men answered nothing, but they shuffled nearer the door.\n\u2018I know her, I tell you,\u2019 he continued. \u2018She was alive and hearty yesterday. It\u2019s impossible she can be dead; it\u2019s impossible you should have got this body fairly.\u2019\n\u2018Sure, sir, you\u2019re mistaken entirely,\u2019 said one of the men.\nBut the other looked Fettes darkly in the eyes, and demanded the money on the spot.\nIt was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger. The lad\u2019s heart failed him. He stammered some excuses, counted out the sum, and saw his hateful visitors depart. No sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts. By a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before. He saw, with horror, marks upon her body that might well betoken violence. A panic seized him, and he took refuge in his room. There he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made; considered soberly the bearing of Mr. K\u2014\u2019s instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business, and at last, in sore perplexity, determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior, the class assistant.\nThis was a young doctor, Wolfe Macfarlane, a high favourite among all the reckless students, clever, dissipated, and unscrupulous to the last degree. He had travelled and studied abroad. His manners were agreeable and a little forward. He was an authority on the stage, skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golf-club; he dressed with nice audacity, and, to put the finishing touch upon his glory, he kept a gig and a strong trotting-horse. With Fettes he was on terms of intimacy; indeed, their relative positions called for some community of life; and when subjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in Macfarlane\u2019s gig, visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard, and return before dawn with their booty to the door of the dissecting-room.\nOn that particular morning Macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his wont. Fettes heard him, and met him on the stairs, told him his story, and showed him the cause of his alarm. Macfarlane examined the marks on her body.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said with a nod, \u2018it looks fishy.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what should I do?\u2019 asked Fettes.\n\u2018Do?\u2019 repeated the other. \u2018Do you want to do anything? Least said soonest mended, I should say.\u2019\n\u2018Some one else might recognise her,\u2019 objected Fettes. \u2018She was as well known as the Castle Rock.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll hope not,\u2019 said Macfarlane, \u2018and if anybody does\u2014well, you didn\u2019t, don\u2019t you see, and there\u2019s an end. The fact is, this has been going on too long. Stir up the mud, and you\u2019ll get K\u2014 into the most unholy trouble; you\u2019ll be in a shocking box yourself. So will I, if you come to that. I should like to know how any one of us would look, or what the devil we should have to say for ourselves, in any Christian witness-box. For me, you know there\u2019s one thing certain\u2014that, practically speaking, all our subjects have been murdered.\u2019\n\u2018Macfarlane!\u2019 cried Fettes.\n\u2018Come now!\u2019 sneered the other. \u2018As if you hadn\u2019t suspected it yourself!\u2019\n\u2018Suspecting is one thing\u2014\u2019\n\u2018And proof another. Yes, I know; and I\u2019m as sorry as you are this should have come here,\u2019 tapping the body with his cane. \u2018The next best thing for me is not to recognise it; and,\u2019 he added coolly, \u2018I don\u2019t. You may, if you please. I don\u2019t dictate, but I think a man of the world would do as I do; and I may add, I fancy that is what K\u2014 would look for at our hands. The question is, Why did he choose us two for his assistants? And I answer, because he didn\u2019t want old wives.\u2019\nThis was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like Fettes. He agreed to imitate Macfarlane. The body of the unfortunate girl was duly dissected, and no one remarked or appeared to recognise her.\nOne afternoon, when his day\u2019s work was over, Fettes dropped into a popular tavern and found Macfarlane sitting with a stranger. This was a small man, very pale and dark, with coal-black eyes. The cut of his features gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly realised in his manners, for he proved, upon a nearer acquaintance, coarse, vulgar, and stupid. He exercised, however, a very remarkable control over Macfarlane; issued orders like the Great Bashaw; became inflamed at the least discussion or delay, and commented rudely on the servility with which he was obeyed. This most offensive person took a fancy to Fettes on the spot, plied him with drinks, and honoured him with unusual confidences on his past career. If a tenth part of what he confessed were true, he was a very loathsome rogue; and the lad\u2019s vanity was tickled by the attention of so experienced a man.\n\u2018I\u2019m a pretty bad fellow myself,\u2019 the stranger remarked, \u2018but Macfarlane is the boy\u2014Toddy Macfarlane I call him. Toddy, order your friend another glass.\u2019 Or it might be, \u2018Toddy, you jump up and shut the door.\u2019 \u2018Toddy hates me,\u2019 he said again. \u2018Oh yes, Toddy, you do!\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t you call me that confounded name,\u2019 growled Macfarlane.\n\u2018Hear him! Did you ever see the lads play knife? He would like to do that all over my body,\u2019 remarked the stranger.\n\u2018We medicals have a better way than that,\u2019 said Fettes. \u2018When we dislike a dead friend of ours, we dissect him.\u2019\nMacfarlane looked up sharply, as though this jest were scarcely to his mind.\nThe afternoon passed. Gray, for that was the stranger\u2019s name, invited Fettes to join them at dinner, ordered a feast so sumptuous that the tavern was thrown into commotion, and when all was done commanded Macfarlane to settle the bill. It was late before they separated; the man Gray was incapably drunk. Macfarlane, sobered by his fury, chewed the cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he had been obliged to swallow. Fettes, with various liquors singing in his head, returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in abeyance. Next day Macfarlane was absent from the class, and Fettes smiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable Gray from tavern to tavern. As soon as the hour of liberty had struck he posted from place to place in quest of his last night\u2019s companions. He could find them, however, nowhere; so returned early to his rooms, went early to bed, and slept the sleep of the just.\nAt four in the morning he was awakened by the well-known signal. Descending to the door, he was filled with astonishment to find Macfarlane with his gig, and in the gig one of those long and ghastly packages with which he was so well acquainted.\n\u2018What?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Have you been out alone? How did you manage?\u2019\nBut Macfarlane silenced him roughly, bidding him turn to business. When they had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table, Macfarlane made at first as if he were going away. Then he paused and seemed to hesitate; and then, \u2018You had better look at the face,\u2019 said he, in tones of some constraint. \u2018You had better,\u2019 he repeated, as Fettes only stared at him in wonder.\n\u2018But where, and how, and when did you come by it?\u2019 cried the other.\n\u2018Look at the face,\u2019 was the only answer.\nFettes was staggered; strange doubts assailed him. He looked from the young doctor to the body, and then back again. At last, with a start, he did as he was bidden. He had almost expected the sight that met his eyes, and yet the shock was cruel. To see, fixed in the rigidity of death and naked on that coarse layer of sackcloth, the man whom he had left well clad and full of meat and sin upon the threshold of a tavern, awoke, even in the thoughtless Fettes, some of the terrors of the conscience. It was a cras tibi which re-echoed in his soul, that two whom he had known should have come to lie upon these icy tables. Yet these were only secondary thoughts. His first concern regarded Wolfe. Unprepared for a challenge so momentous, he knew not how to look his comrade in the face. He durst not meet his eye, and he had neither words nor voice at his command.\nIt was Macfarlane himself who made the first advance. He came up quietly behind and laid his hand gently but firmly on the other\u2019s shoulder.\n\u2018Richardson,\u2019 said he, \u2018may have the head.\u2019\nNow Richardson was a student who had long been anxious for that portion of the human subject to dissect. There was no answer, and the murderer resumed: \u2018Talking of business, you must pay me; your accounts, you see, must tally.\u2019\nFettes found a voice, the ghost of his own: \u2018Pay you!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Pay you for that?\u2019\n\u2018Why, yes, of course you must. By all means and on every possible account, you must,\u2019 returned the other. \u2018I dare not give it for nothing, you dare not take it for nothing; it would compromise us both. This is another case like Jane Galbraith\u2019s. The more things are wrong the more we must act as if all were right. Where does old K\u2014 keep his money?\u2019\n\u2018There,\u2019 answered Fettes hoarsely, pointing to a cupboard in the corner.\n\u2018Give me the key, then,\u2019 said the other, calmly, holding out his hand.\nThere was an instant\u2019s hesitation, and the die was cast. Macfarlane could not suppress a nervous twitch, the infinitesimal mark of an immense relief, as he felt the key between his fingers. He opened the cupboard, brought out pen and ink and a paper-book that stood in one compartment, and separated from the funds in a drawer a sum suitable to the occasion.\n\u2018Now, look here,\u2019 he said, \u2018there is the payment made\u2014first proof of your good faith: first step to your security. You have now to clinch it by a second. Enter the payment in your book, and then you for your part may defy the devil.\u2019\nThe next few seconds were for Fettes an agony of thought; but in balancing his terrors it was the most immediate that triumphed. Any future difficulty seemed almost welcome if he could avoid a present quarrel with Macfarlane. He set down the candle which he had been carrying all this time, and with a steady hand entered the date, the nature, and the amount of the transaction.\n\u2018And now,\u2019 said Macfarlane, \u2018it\u2019s only fair that you should pocket the lucre. I\u2019ve had my share already. By the bye, when a man of the world falls into a bit of luck, has a few shillings extra in his pocket\u2014I\u2019m ashamed to speak of it, but there\u2019s a rule of conduct in the case. No treating, no purchase of expensive class-books, no squaring of old debts; borrow, don\u2019t lend.\u2019\n\u2018Macfarlane,\u2019 began Fettes, still somewhat hoarsely, \u2018I have put my neck in a halter to oblige you.\u2019\n\u2018To oblige me?\u2019 cried Wolfe. \u2018Oh, come! You did, as near as I can see the matter, what you downright had to do in self-defence. Suppose I got into trouble, where would you be? This second little matter flows clearly from the first. Mr. Gray is the continuation of Miss Galbraith. You can\u2019t begin and then stop. If you begin, you must keep on beginning; that\u2019s the truth. No rest for the wicked.\u2019\nA horrible sense of blackness and the treachery of fate seized hold upon the soul of the unhappy student.\n\u2018My God!\u2019 he cried, \u2018but what have I done? and when did I begin? To be made a class assistant\u2014in the name of reason, where\u2019s the harm in that? Service wanted the position; Service might have got it. Would he have been where I am now?\u2019\n\u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 said Macfarlane, \u2018what a boy you are! What harm has come to you? What harm can come to you if you hold your tongue? Why, man, do you know what this life is? There are two squads of us\u2014the lions and the lambs. If you\u2019re a lamb, you\u2019ll come to lie upon these tables like Gray or Jane Galbraith; if you\u2019re a lion, you\u2019ll live and drive a horse like me, like K\u2014, like all the world with any wit or courage. You\u2019re staggered at the first. But look at K\u2014! My dear fellow, you\u2019re clever, you have pluck. I like you, and K\u2014 likes you. You were born to lead the hunt; and I tell you, on my honour and my experience of life, three days from now you\u2019ll laugh at all these scarecrows like a High School boy at a farce.\u2019\nAnd with that Macfarlane took his departure and drove off up the wynd in his gig to get under cover before daylight. Fettes was thus left alone with his regrets. He saw the miserable peril in which he stood involved. He saw, with inexpressible dismay, that there was no limit to his weakness, and that, from concession to concession, he had fallen from the arbiter of Macfarlane\u2019s destiny to his paid and helpless accomplice. He would have given the world to have been a little braver at the time, but it did not occur to him that he might still be brave. The secret of Jane Galbraith and the cursed entry in the day-book closed his mouth.\nHours passed; the class began to arrive; the members of the unhappy Gray were dealt out to one and to another, and received without remark. Richardson was made happy with the head; and before the hour of freedom rang Fettes trembled with exultation to perceive how far they had already gone toward safety.\nFor two days he continued to watch, with increasing joy, the dreadful process of disguise.\nOn the third day Macfarlane made his appearance. He had been ill, he said; but he made up for lost time by the energy with which he directed the students. To Richardson in particular he extended the most valuable assistance and advice, and that student, encouraged by the praise of the demonstrator, burned high with ambitious hopes, and saw the medal already in his grasp.\nBefore the week was out Macfarlane\u2019s prophecy had been fulfilled. Fettes had outlived his terrors and had forgotten his baseness. He began to plume himself upon his courage, and had so arranged the story in his mind that he could look back on these events with an unhealthy pride. Of his accomplice he saw but little. They met, of course, in the business of the class; they received their orders together from Mr. K\u2014. At times they had a word or two in private, and Macfarlane was from first to last particularly kind and jovial. But it was plain that he avoided any reference to their common secret; and even when Fettes whispered to him that he had cast in his lot with the lions and foresworn the lambs, he only signed to him smilingly to hold his peace.\nAt length an occasion arose which threw the pair once more into a closer union. Mr. K\u2014 was again short of subjects; pupils were eager, and it was a part of this teacher\u2019s pretensions to be always well supplied. At the same time there came the news of a burial in the rustic graveyard of Glencorse. Time has little changed the place in question. It stood then, as now, upon a cross road, out of call of human habitations, and buried fathom deep in the foliage of six cedar trees. The cries of the sheep upon the neighbouring hills, the streamlets upon either hand, one loudly singing among pebbles, the other dripping furtively from pond to pond, the stir of the wind in mountainous old flowering chestnuts, and once in seven days the voice of the bell and the old tunes of the precentor, were the only sounds that disturbed the silence around the rural church. The Resurrection Man\u2014to use a byname of the period\u2014was not to be deterred by any of the sanctities of customary piety. It was part of his trade to despise and desecrate the scrolls and trumpets of old tombs, the paths worn by the feet of worshippers and mourners, and the offerings and the inscriptions of bereaved affection. To rustic neighbourhoods, where love is more than commonly tenacious, and where some bonds of blood or fellowship unite the entire society of a parish, the body-snatcher, far from being repelled by natural respect, was attracted by the ease and safety of the task. To bodies that had been laid in earth, in joyful expectation of a far different awakening, there came that hasty, lamp-lit, terror-haunted resurrection of the spade and mattock. The coffin was forced, the cerements torn, and the melancholy relics, clad in sackcloth, after being rattled for hours on moonless byways, were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of gaping boys.\nSomewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb, Fettes and Macfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet resting-place. The wife of a farmer, a woman who had lived for sixty years, and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly conversation, was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried, dead and naked, to that far-away city that she had always honoured with her Sunday\u2019s best; the place beside her family was to be empty till the crack of doom; her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to that last curiosity of the anatomist.\nLate one afternoon the pair set forth, well wrapped in cloaks and furnished with a formidable bottle. It rained without remission\u2014a cold, dense, lashing rain. Now and again there blew a puff of wind, but these sheets of falling water kept it down. Bottle and all, it was a sad and silent drive as far as Penicuik, where they were to spend the evening. They stopped once, to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from the churchyard, and once again at the Fisher\u2019s Tryst, to have a toast before the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of ale. When they reached their journey\u2019s end the gig was housed, the horse was fed and comforted, and the two young doctors in a private room sat down to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded. The lights, the fire, the beating rain upon the window, the cold, incongruous work that lay before them, added zest to their enjoyment of the meal. With every glass their cordiality increased. Soon Macfarlane handed a little pile of gold to his companion.\n\u2018A compliment,\u2019 he said. \u2018Between friends these little d-d accommodations ought to fly like pipe-lights.\u2019\nFettes pocketed the money, and applauded the sentiment to the echo. \u2018You are a philosopher,\u2019 he cried. \u2018I was an ass till I knew you. You and K\u2014 between you, by the Lord Harry! but you\u2019ll make a man of me.\u2019\n\u2018Of course we shall,\u2019 applauded Macfarlane. \u2018A man? I tell you, it required a man to back me up the other morning. There are some big, brawling, forty-year-old cowards who would have turned sick at the look of the d-d thing; but not you\u2014you kept your head. I watched you.\u2019\n\u2018Well, and why not?\u2019 Fettes thus vaunted himself. \u2018It was no affair of mine. There was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance, and on the other I could count on your gratitude, don\u2019t you see?\u2019 And he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang.\nMacfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant words. He may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so successfully, but he had no time to interfere, for the other noisily continued in this boastful strain:\u2014\n\u2018The great thing is not to be afraid. Now, between you and me, I don\u2019t want to hang\u2014that\u2019s practical; but for all cant, Macfarlane, I was born with a contempt. Hell, God, Devil, right, wrong, sin, crime, and all the old gallery of curiosities\u2014they may frighten boys, but men of the world, like you and me, despise them. Here\u2019s to the memory of Gray!\u2019\nIt was by this time growing somewhat late. The gig, according to order, was brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining, and the young men had to pay their bill and take the road. They announced that they were bound for Peebles, and drove in that direction till they were clear of the last houses of the town; then, extinguishing the lamps, returned upon their course, and followed a by-road toward Glencorse. There was no sound but that of their own passage, and the incessant, strident pouring of the rain. It was pitch dark; here and there a white gate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across the night; but for the most part it was at a foot pace, and almost groping, that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to their solemn and isolated destination. In the sunken woods that traverse the neighbourhood of the burying-ground the last glimmer failed them, and it became necessary to kindle a match and re-illumine one of the lanterns of the gig. Thus, under the dripping trees, and environed by huge and moving shadows, they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours.\nThey were both experienced in such affairs, and powerful with the spade; and they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were rewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid. At the same moment Macfarlane, having hurt his hand upon a stone, flung it carelessly above his head. The grave, in which they now stood almost to the shoulders, was close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard; and the gig lamp had been propped, the better to illuminate their labours, against a tree, and on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream. Chance had taken a sure aim with the stone. Then came a clang of broken glass; night fell upon them; sounds alternately dull and ringing announced the bounding of the lantern down the bank, and its occasional collision with the trees. A stone or two, which it had dislodged in its descent, rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen; and then silence, like night, resumed its sway; and they might bend their hearing to its utmost pitch, but naught was to be heard except the rain, now marching to the wind, now steadily falling over miles of open country.\nThey were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it wisest to complete it in the dark. The coffin was exhumed and broken open; the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to the gig; one mounted to keep it in its place, and the other, taking the horse by the mouth, groped along by wall and bush until they reached the wider road by the Fisher\u2019s Tryst. Here was a faint, diffused radiancy, which they hailed like daylight; by that they pushed the horse to a good pace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town.\nThey had both been wetted to the skin during their operations, and now, as the gig jumped among the deep ruts, the thing that stood propped between them fell now upon one and now upon the other. At every repetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with the greater haste; and the process, natural although it was, began to tell upon the nerves of the companions. Macfarlane made some ill-favoured jest about the farmer\u2019s wife, but it came hollowly from his lips, and was allowed to drop in silence. Still their unnatural burden bumped from side to side; and now the head would be laid, as if in confidence, upon their shoulders, and now the drenching sack-cloth would flap icily about their faces. A creeping chill began to possess the soul of Fettes. He peered at the bundle, and it seemed somehow larger than at first. All over the country-side, and from every degree of distance, the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations; and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished, that some nameless change had befallen the dead body, and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling.\n\u2018For God\u2019s sake,\u2019 said he, making a great effort to arrive at speech, \u2018for God\u2019s sake, let\u2019s have a light!\u2019\nSeemingly Macfarlane was affected in the same direction; for, though he made no reply, he stopped the horse, passed the reins to his companion, got down, and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp. They had by that time got no farther than the cross-road down to Auchenclinny. The rain still poured as though the deluge were returning, and it was no easy matter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness. When at last the flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to expand and clarify, and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the gig, it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the thing they had along with them. The rain had moulded the rough sacking to the outlines of the body underneath; the head was distinct from the trunk, the shoulders plainly modelled; something at once spectral and human riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive.\nFor some time Macfarlane stood motionless, holding up the lamp. A nameless dread was swathed, like a wet sheet, about the body, and tightened the white skin upon the face of Fettes; a fear that was meaningless, a horror of what could not be, kept mounting to his brain. Another beat of the watch, and he had spoken. But his comrade forestalled him.\n\u2018That is not a woman,\u2019 said Macfarlane, in a hushed voice.\n\u2018It was a woman when we put her in,\u2019 whispered Fettes.\n\u2018Hold that lamp,\u2019 said the other. \u2018I must see her face.\u2019\nAnd as Fettes took the lamp his companion untied the fastenings of the sack and drew down the cover from the head. The light fell very clear upon the dark, well-moulded features and smooth-shaven cheeks of a too familiar countenance, often beheld in dreams of both of these young men. A wild yell rang up into the night; each leaped from his own side into the roadway: the lamp fell, broke, and was extinguished; and the horse, terrified by this unusual commotion, bounded and went off toward Edinburgh at a gallop, bearing along with it, sole occupant of the gig, the body of the dead and long-dissected Gray.\n"

                "content": "\nMy memories are very confused. There is even much doubt as to where they begin; for at times I feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me, while at other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey, formless infinity. I am not even certain how I am communicating this message. While I know I am speaking, I have a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what I say to the points where I wish to be heard. My identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy. I seem to have suffered a great shock\u2014perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique, incredible experience.\nThese cycles of experience, of course, all stem from that worm-riddled book. I remember when I found it\u2014in a dimly lighted place near the black, oily river where the mists always swirl. That place was very old, and the ceiling-high shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves. There were, besides, great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins; and it was in one of these heaps that I found the thing. I never learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling.\nThere was a formula\u2014a sort of list of things to say and do\u2014which I recognised as something black and forbidden; something which I had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe\u2019s guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb. It was a key\u2014a guide\u2014to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know. Not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it, but this book was very old indeed. No printing-press, but the hand of some half-crazed monk, had traced these ominous Latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity.\nI remember how the old man leered and tittered, and made a curious sign with his hand when I bore it away. He had refused to take pay for it, and only long afterward did I guess why. As I hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist-choked waterfront streets I had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet. The centuried, tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity\u2014as if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened. I felt that those walls and overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungous plaster and timber\u2014with fishy, eye-like, diamond-paned windows that leered\u2014could hardly desist from advancing and crushing me . . . yet I had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away.\nI remember how I read the book at last\u2014white-faced, and locked in the attic room that I had long devoted to strange searchings. The great house was very still, for I had not gone up till after midnight. I think I had a family then\u2014though the details are very uncertain\u2014and I know there were many servants. Just what the year was, I cannot say; for since then I have known many ages and dimensions, and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned. It was by the light of candles that I read\u2014I recall the relentless dripping of the wax\u2014and there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries. I seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if I feared to hear some very remote, intruding note among them.\nThen came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city. It came as I droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay, and I knew amidst my shudders what it meant. For he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow, and never again can he be alone. I had evoked\u2014and the book was indeed all I had suspected. That night I passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision, and when morning found me in the attic room I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which I had never seen before.\nNor could I ever after see the world as I had known it. Mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future, and every once-familiar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight. From then on I walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and half-known shapes; and with each new gateway crossed, the less plainly could I recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which I had so long been bound. What I saw about me none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought mad. Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side. But still I read more\u2014in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me\u2014and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos.\nI remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from Tartary had brought. The walls melted away, and I was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle-like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me. After a while there was utter blackness, and then the light of myriad stars forming strange, alien constellations. Finally I saw a green-litten plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion I had ever known or read of or dreamed of. As I floated closer to that city I saw a great square building of stone in an open space, and felt a hideous fear clutching at me. I screamed and struggled, and after a blankness was again in my attic room, sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor. In that night\u2019s wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former night\u2019s wandering; but there was more of terror because I knew I was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than I had ever been before. Thereafter I was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence I could never return.\n"

                "content": "\nWithout, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.\n\u201cHark at the wind,\u201d said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.\n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. \u201cCheck.\u201d\n\u201cI should hardly think that he\u2019s come tonight, \u201d said his father, with his hand poised over the board.\n\u201cMate,\u201d replied the son.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of living so far out,\u201d balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; \u201cOf all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path\u2019s a bog, and the road\u2019s a torrent. I don\u2019t know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind, dear,\u201d said his wife soothingly; \u201cperhaps you\u2019ll win the next one.\u201d\nMr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. the words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.\nThe old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, \u201cTut, tut!\u201d and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.\n\u201cSergeant-Major Morris, \u201d he said, introducing him.\nThe Sergeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.\nAt the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.\n\u201cTwenty-one years of it,\u201d said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. \u201cWhen he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.\u201d\n\u201cHe don\u2019t look to have taken much harm.\u201d said Mrs. White politely.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go to India myself,\u201d said the old man, \u201cjust to look around a bit, you know.\u201d\n\u201cBetter where you are,\u201d said the Sergeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.\n\u201cI should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,\u201d said the old man. \u201cwhat was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey\u2019s paw or something, Morris?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d said the soldier hastily. \u201cLeastways, nothing worth hearing.\u201d\n\u201cMonkey\u2019s paw?\u201d said Mrs. White curiously.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps.\u201d said the Sergeant-Major off-handedly.\nHis three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.\n\u201cTo look at,\u201d said the Sergeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, \u201cit\u2019s just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.\u201d\nHe took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.\n\u201cAnd what is there special about it?\u201d inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.\n\u201cIt had a spell put on it by an old Fakir,\u201d said the Sergeant-Major, \u201ca very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people\u2019s lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.\u201d\nHis manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you have three, sir?\u201d said Herbert White cleverly.\nThe soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth. \u201cI have,\u201d he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.\n\u201cAnd did you really have the three wishes granted?\u201d asked Mrs. White.\n\u201cI did,\u201d said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.\n\u201cAnd has anybody else wished?\u201d persisted the old lady.\n\u201cThe first man had his three wishes. Yes,\u201d was the reply, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That\u2019s how I got the paw.\u201d\nHis tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had your three wishes it\u2019s no good to you now then Morris,\u201d said the old man at last. \u201cWhat do you keep it for?\u201d\nThe soldier shook his head. \u201cFancy I suppose,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI did have some idea of selling it, but I don\u2019t think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won\u2019t buy. They think it\u2019s a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.\u201d\n\u201cIf you could have another three wishes,\u201d said the old man, eyeing him keenly, \u201cwould you have them?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the other. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.\n\u201cBetter let it burn,\u201d said the soldier solemnly.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it Morris,\u201d said the other, \u201cgive it to me.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d said his friend doggedly. \u201cI threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don\u2019t blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man.\u201d\nThe other shook his head and examined his possession closely. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d he inquired.\n\u201cHold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud,\u201d said the Sergeant-Major, \u201cBut I warn you of the consequences.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like the \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019\u200a\u201d, said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me.\u201d\nHer husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.\n\u201cIf you must wish,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cWish for something sensible.\u201d\nMr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier\u2019s adventures in India.\n\u201cIf the tale about the monkey\u2019s paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,\u201d said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, \u201cwe shan\u2019t make much out of it.\u201d\n\u201cDid you give anything for it, father?\u201d inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.\n\u201cA trifle,\u201d said he, colouring slightly, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.\u201d\n\u201cLikely,\u201d said Herbert, with pretended horror. \u201cWhy, we\u2019re going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can\u2019t be henpecked.\u201d\nHe darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.\nMr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to wish for, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve got all I want.\u201d\n\u201cIf you only cleared the house, you\u2019d be quite happy, wouldn\u2019t you!\u201d said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. \u201cWell, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that\u2019ll just do it.\u201d\nHis father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.\n\u201cI wish for two hundred pounds,\u201d said the old man distinctly.\nA fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.\n\u201cIt moved,\u201d he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. \u201cAs I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see the money,\u201d said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, \u201cand I bet I never shall.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been your fancy, father,\u201d said his wife, regarding him anxiously.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNever mind, though; there\u2019s no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.\u201d\nThey sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.\n\u201cI expect you\u2019ll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,\u201d said Herbert, as he bade them good night, \u201cand something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.\u201d\nHe sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey\u2019s paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.\n \nPart II\nIn the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.\n\u201cI suppose all old soldiers are the same,\u201d said Mrs White. \u201cThe idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?\u201d\n\u201cMight drop on his head from the sky,\u201d said the frivolous Herbert.\n\u201cMorris said the things happened so naturally,\u201d said his father, \u201cthat you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cWell don\u2019t break into the money before I come back,\u201d said Herbert as he rose from the table. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.\u201d\nHis mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband\u2019s credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman\u2019s knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sergeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor\u2019s bill.\n\u201cHerbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,\u201d she said as they sat at dinner.\n\u201cI dare say,\u201d said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \u201cbut for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I\u2019ll swear to.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought it did,\u201d said the old lady soothingly.\n\u201cI say it did,\u201d replied the other. \u201cThere was no thought about it; I had just - What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nHis wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.\nShe brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband\u2019s coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.\n\u201cI - was asked to call,\u201d he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. \u201cI come from \u2018Maw and Meggins.\u2019\u200a\u201d\nThe old lady started. \u201cIs anything the matter?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cHas anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?\nHer husband interposed. \u201cThere there mother,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cSit down, and don\u2019t jump to conclusions. You\u2019ve not brought bad news, I\u2019m sure sir,\u201d and eyed the other wistfully.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry - \u201d began the visitor.\n\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d demanded the mother wildly.\nThe visitor bowed in assent. \u201cBadly hurt,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbut he is not in any pain.\u201d\n\u201cOh thank God!\u201d said the old woman, clasping her hands. \u201cThank God for that! Thank - \u201d\nShe broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.\n\u201cHe was caught in the machinery,\u201d said the visitor at length in a low voice.\n\u201cCaught in the machinery,\u201d repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion, \u201cyes.\u201d\nHe sat staring out the window, and taking his wife\u2019s hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.\n\u201cHe was the only one left to us,\u201d he said, turning gently to the visitor. \u201cIt is hard.\u201d\nThe other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. \u201cThe firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\u201d he said, without looking round. \u201cI beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.\u201d\nThere was no reply; the old woman\u2019s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband\u2019s face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.\n\u201cI was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility,\u201d continued the other. \u201cThey admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son\u2019s services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.\u201d\nMr. White dropped his wife\u2019s hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred pounds,\u201d was the answer.\nUnconscious of his wife\u2019s shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.\n \nPart III\nIn the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen - something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.\nBut the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation - the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.\nIt was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.\n\u201cCome back,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cYou will be cold.\u201d\n\u201cIt is colder for my son,\u201d said the old woman, and wept afresh.\nThe sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.\n\u201cTHE PAW!\u201d she cried wildly. \u201cTHE MONKEY\u2019S PAW!\u201d\nHe started up in alarm. \u201cWhere? Where is it? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nShe came stumbling across the room toward him. \u201cI want it,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve not destroyed it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the parlour, on the bracket,\u201d he replied, marveling. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.\n\u201cI only just thought of it,\u201d she said hysterically. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of it before? Why didn\u2019t you think of it?\u201d\n\u201cThink of what?\u201d he questioned.\n\u201cThe other two wishes,\u201d she replied rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had one.\u201d\n\u201cWas not that enough?\u201d he demanded fiercely.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she cried triumphantly; \u201cWe\u2019ll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\u201d\nThe man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. \u201cGood God, you are mad!\u201d he cried aghast. \u201cGet it,\u201d she panted; \u201cget it quickly, and wish - Oh my boy, my boy!\u201d\nHer husband struck a match and lit the candle. \u201cGet back to bed he said unsteadily. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are saying.\u201d\n\u201cWe had the first wish granted,\u201d said the old woman, feverishly; \u201cwhy not the second?\u201d\n\u201cA coincidence,\u201d stammered the old man.\n\u201cGo get it and wish,\u201d cried his wife, quivering with excitement.\nThe old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. \u201cHe has been dead ten days, and besides he - I would not tell you else, but - I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\u201d\n\u201cBring him back,\u201d cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. \u201cDo you think I fear the child I have nursed?\u201d\nHe went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.\nEven his wife\u2019s face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.\n\u201cWISH!\u201d she cried in a strong voice.\n\u201cIt is foolish and wicked,\u201d he faltered.\n\u201cWISH!\u201d repeated his wife.\nHe raised his hand. \u201cI wish my son alive again.\u201d\nThe talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.\nHe sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.\nNeither spoke, but sat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.\nAt the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.\nThe matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S THAT?\u201d cried the old woman, starting up.\n\u201cA rat,\u201d said the old man in shaking tones - \u201ca rat. It passed me on the stairs.\u201d\nHis wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Herbert!\u201d\nShe ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my boy; it\u2019s Herbert!\u201d she cried, struggling mechanically. \u201cI forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.\u201d\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let it in,\u201d cried the old man, trembling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of your own son,\u201d she cried struggling. \u201cLet me go. I\u2019m coming, Herbert; I\u2019m coming.\u201d\nThere was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman\u2019s voice, strained and panting.\n\u201cThe bolt,\u201d she cried loudly. \u201cCome down. I can\u2019t reach it.\u201d\nBut her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey\u2019s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.\nThe knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.\n"

                "content": "\nFor the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not - and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terrified - have tortured - have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror - to many they will seem less terrible than barroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place - some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.\nFrom my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.\nI married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.\nThis latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this point - and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.\nPluto - this was the cat\u2019s name - was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.\nOur friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character - through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance - had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. But my disease grew upon me - for what disease is like Alcohol! - and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish - even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.\nOne night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.\nWhen reason returned with the morning - when I had slept off the fumes of the night\u2019s debauch - I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\nIn the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of perverseness. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart - one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law , merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself - to offer violence to its own nature - to do wrong for the wrong\u2019s sake only - that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; - hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; - hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; - hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin - a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it - if such a thing wore possible - even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.\nOn the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.\nI am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain of facts - and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire - a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words \u201cstrange!\u201d \u201csingular!\u201d and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal\u2019s neck.\nWhen I first beheld this apparition - for I could scarcely regard it as less - my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd - by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\nAlthough I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.\nOne night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was a black cat - a very large one - fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it off the landlord; but this person made no claim to it - knew nothing of it - had never seen it before.\nI continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.\nFor my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but - I know not how or why it was - its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually - very gradually - I came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\nWhat added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\nWith my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly - let me confess it at once - by absolute dread of the beast.\nThis dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil - and yet I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own - yes, even in this felon\u2019s cell, I am almost ashamed to own - that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees - degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject as fanciful - it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name - and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared - it was now, I say, the image of a hideous - of a ghastly thing - of the GALLOWS ! - oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of Crime - of Agony and of Death !\nAnd now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity. And a brute beast - whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed - a brute beast to work out for me - for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God - so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face, and its vast weight - an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off - incumbent eternally upon my heart!\nBeneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates - the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.\nOne day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.\nThis hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard - about packing it in a box, as if merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar - as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.\nFor a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself - \u201cHere at least, then, my labor has not been in vain.\u201d\nMy next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the night - and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!\nThe second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not. Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had been instituted - but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon my future felicity as secured.\nUpon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, \u201cI delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this - this is a very well constructed house.\u201d [In the rabid desire to say something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.] - \u201cI may say an excellently well constructed house. These walls are you going, gentlemen? - these walls are solidly put together;\u201d and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.\nBut may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb! - by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman - a howl - a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\nOf my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the monster up within the tomb\n"

                "content": "\nIn 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier\u2014restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which to-day we should call indigence than impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meagre comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of \u201cimprovement\u201d\u2014a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man\u2019s zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \u201cchinking\u201d of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up\u2014nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant\u2019s dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living to-day who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.\nThe man\u2019s name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lustreless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders\u2014a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man\u2019s story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story\u2014excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter\u2014that supplied by my grandfather.\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm\u2014the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support\u2014he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man\u2019s widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep\u2014surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. \u201cTo-morrow,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cI shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now\u2014she is dead, of course, but it is all right\u2014it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\u201d\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right\u2014that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for (and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture) no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table\u2019s edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening wood! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened\u2014he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see\u2014he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who\u2014what had waked him, and where was it?\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step\u2014another\u2014sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited\u2014waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman\u2019s name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal\u2019s ear.\n"

It is enough to know that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned, and that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil, coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not on the fields and groves but on a dim court where other windows stared in dull despair. From that casement one might see only walls and windows, except sometimes when one leaned far out and peered aloft at the small stars that passed. And because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man who dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the greyness of tall cities. After years he began to call the slow-sailing stars by name, and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existence no common eye suspects. And one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher\u2019s window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder.\nThere came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men\u2019s calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore; a green shore fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes.\n"

                "content": "\nI have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong. Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences\u2014Freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism\u2014there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier. From my experience I cannot doubt but that man, when lost to terrestrial consciousness, is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know; and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking. From those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little. We may guess that in dreams life, matter, and vitality, as the earth knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them. Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon.\nIt was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20141901, when to the state psychopathic institution in which I served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly. His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a little-travelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts. Among these odd folk, who correspond exactly to the decadent element of \u201cwhite trash\u201d in the South, law and morals are non-existent; and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of the native American people.\nJoe Slater, who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state policemen, and who was described as a highly dangerous character, certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when first I beheld him. Though well above the middle stature, and of somewhat brawny frame, he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale, sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes, the scantiness of his neglected and never-shaven growth of yellow beard, and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip. His age was unknown, since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist; but from the baldness of his head in front, and from the decayed condition of his teeth, the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty.\nFrom the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case. This man, a vagabond, hunter, and trapper, had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates. He had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace. Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without apprehension. He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable normality like that of the other hill-dwellers.\nAs Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities. One day near noon, after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon, the man had roused himself most suddenly; with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabin\u2014a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself. Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting his determination to reach some \u2018big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away\u2019. As two men of moderate size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain \u2018thing that shines and shakes and laughs\u2019. At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would \u2018jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him\u2019. Family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp-like thing that had been a living man but an hour before. None of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him, and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold; but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ravine, they realised that he had somehow managed to survive, and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary. Then had followed an armed searching party, whose purpose (whatever it may have been originally) became that of a sheriff\u2019s posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed, then questioned, and finally joined the seekers.\nOn the third day Slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from Albany examined him as soon as his senses returned. To them he told a simple story. He had, he said, gone to sleep one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor. He had awaked to find himself standing bloody-handed in the snow before his cabin, the mangled corpse of his neighbour Peter Slader at his feet. Horrified, he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime. Beyond these things he seemed to know nothing, nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact. That night Slater slept quietly, and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression. Dr. Barnard, who had been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality; and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening, as if of intelligent determination. But when questioned, Slater relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer, and only reiterated what he had said on the preceding day.\nOn the third morning occurred the first of the man\u2019s mental attacks. After some show of uneasiness in sleep, he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a strait-jacket. The alienists listened with keen attention to his words, since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbours. Slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes, babbling in his backwoods dialect of great edifices of light, oceans of space, strange music, and shadowy mountains and valleys. But most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him. This vast, vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong, and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire. In order to reach it, he said, he would soar through abysses of emptiness, burning every obstacle that stood in his way. Thus ran his discourse, until with the greatest suddenness he ceased. The fire of madness died from his eyes, and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound. Dr. Barnard unbuckled the leathern harness and did not restore it till night, when he succeeded in persuading Slater to don it of his own volition, for his own good. The man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queerly, though he knew not why.\nWithin a week two more attacks appeared, but from them the doctors learned little. On the source of Slater\u2019s visions they speculated at length, for since he could neither read nor write, and had apparently never heard a legend or fairy tale, his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable. That it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner. He raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret; things which he claimed to have experienced, but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration. The alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble; dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man. With due formality Slater was tried for murder, acquitted on the ground of insanity, and committed to the institution wherein I held so humble a post.\nI have said that I am a constant speculator concerning dream life, and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as I had fully ascertained the facts of his case. He seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me; born no doubt of the interest I could not conceal, and the gentle manner in which I questioned him. Not that he ever recognised me during his attacks, when I hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic word-pictures; but he knew me in his quiet hours, when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow, and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never enjoy again. His family never called to see him; probably it had found another temporary head, after the manner of decadent mountain folk.\nBy degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of Joe Slater. The man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike; but his glowing, titanic visions, though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon, were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive. How, I often asked myself, could the stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius? How could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium? More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues.\nAnd yet I could extract nothing definite from the man. The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi-uncorporeal dream life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light; in a region unbounded and unknown to man. That there he was no peasant or degenerate, but a creature of importance and vivid life; moving proudly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain deadly enemy, who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure, and who did not appear to be of human shape, since Slater never referred to it as a man, or as aught save a thing. This thing had done Slater some hideous but unnamed wrong, which the maniac (if maniac he were) yearned to avenge. From the manner in which Slater alluded to their dealings, I judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms; that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy. This impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress. Yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dream-world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought. Could it be that the dream-soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter? Could it be that I was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if I could but learn to discover and read them? I did not tell the older physicians of these things, for middle age is sceptical, cynical, and disinclined to accept new ideas. Besides, the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that I was overworking; that my mind needed a rest.\nIt had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion, convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat, light, and electricity. This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude, pre-radio period. These I had tested with a fellow-student; but achieving no result, had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use. Now, in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of Joe Slater, I sought these instruments again; and spent several days in repairing them for action. When they were complete once more I missed no opportunity for their trial. At each outburst of Slater\u2019s violence, I would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own; constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wave-lengths of intellectual energy. I had but little notion of how the thought-impressions would, if successfully conveyed, arouse an intelligent response in my brain; but I felt certain that I could detect and interpret them. Accordingly I continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature.\n \nIt was on the twenty-first of February, 1901, that the thing finally occurred. As I look back across the years I realise how unreal it seems; and sometimes half wonder if old Dr. Fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination. I recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when I told him, but afterward gave me a nerve-powder and arranged for the half-year\u2019s vacation on which I departed the next week. That fateful night I was wildly agitated and perturbed, for despite the excellent care he had received, Joe Slater was unmistakably dying. Perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed, or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique; but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body. He was drowsy near the end, and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep. I did not strap on the strait-jacket as was customary when he slept, since I saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous, even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away. But I did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic \u201cradio\u201d; hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dream-world in the brief time remaining. In the cell with us was one nurse, a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus, or think to inquire into my course. As the hours wore on I saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep, but I did not disturb him. I myself, lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man, must have nodded a little later.\nThe sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me. Chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty. Walls, columns, and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where I seemed to float in air; extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour. Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes; covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of, yet formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal, plastic entity, which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter. As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold. Amidst this elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come.\nThen the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me, soul to soul, with silent and perfect interchange of thought. The hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow-being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres? We floated thus for a little time, when I perceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us, as though some force were recalling me to earth\u2014where I least wished to go. The form near me seemed to feel a change also, for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion, and itself prepared to quit the scene; fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects. A few more thoughts were exchanged, and I knew that the luminous one and I were being recalled to bondage, though for my brother of light it would be the last time. The sorry planet-shell being well-nigh spent, in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the Milky Way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity.\nA well-defined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as I saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly. Joe Slater was indeed awaking, though probably for the last time. As I looked more closely, I saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of colour which had never before been present. The lips, too, seemed unusual; being tightly compressed, as if by the force of a stronger character than had been Slater\u2019s. The whole face finally began to grow tense, and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes. I did not arouse the sleeping nurse, but readjusted the slightly disarranged head-bands of my telepathic \u201cradio\u201d, intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver. All at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what I beheld. The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent, was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous, expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened. Neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze, and I felt beyond a doubt that I was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high order.\nAt this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it. I closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly, and was rewarded by the positive knowledge that my long-sought mental message had come at last. Each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind, and though no actual language was employed, my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that I seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary English.\n\u201cJoe Slater is dead,\u201d came the soul-petrifying voice or agency from beyond the wall of sleep. My opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious horror, but the blue eyes were still calmly gazing, and the countenance was still intelligently animated. \u201cHe is better dead, for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of cosmic entity. His gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments between ethereal life and planet life. He was too much of an animal, too little a man; yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me, for the cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet. He has been my torment and diurnal prison for forty-two of your terrestrial years. I am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep. I am your brother of light, and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys. It is not permitted me to tell your waking earth-self of your real self, but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travellers in many ages. Next year I may be dwelling in the dark Egypt which you call ancient, or in the cruel empire of Tsan-Chan which is to come three thousand years hence. You and I have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red Arcturus, and dwelt in the bodies of the insect-philosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of Jupiter. How little does the earth-self know of life and its extent! How little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity! Of the oppressor I cannot speak. You on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presence\u2014you who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name of Algol, the Daemon-Star. It is to meet and conquer the oppressor that I have vainly striven for aeons, held back by bodily encumbrances. Tonight I go as a Nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance. Watch me in the sky close by the Daemon-Star. I cannot speak longer, for the body of Joe Slater grows cold and rigid, and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as I wish. You have been my friend in the cosmos; you have been my only friend on this planet\u2014the only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form which lies on this couch. We shall meet again\u2014perhaps in the shining mists of Orion\u2019s Sword, perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric Asia. Perhaps in unremembered dreams tonight; perhaps in some other form an aeon hence, when the solar system shall have been swept away.\u201d\nAt this point the thought-waves abruptly ceased, and the pale eyes of the dreamer\u2014or can I say dead man?\u2014commenced to glaze fishily. In a half-stupor I crossed over to the couch and felt of his wrist, but found it cold, stiff, and pulseless. The sallow cheeks paled again, and the thick lips fell open, disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate Joe Slater. I shivered, pulled a blanket over the hideous face, and awakened the nurse. Then I left the cell and went silently to my room. I had an insistent and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams I should not remember.\nThe climax? What plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect? I have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts, allowing you to construe them as you will. As I have already admitted, my superior, old Dr. Fenton, denies the reality of everything I have related. He vows that I was broken down with nervous strain, and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me. He assures me on his professional honour that Joe Slater was but a low-grade paranoiac, whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folk-tales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities. All this he tells me\u2014yet I cannot forget what I saw in the sky on the night after Slater died. Lest you think me a biassed witness, another\u2019s pen must add this final testimony, which may perhaps supply the climax you expect. I will quote the following account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority, Prof. Garrett P. Serviss:\n \n\u201cOn February 22, 1901, a marvellous new star was discovered by Dr. Anderson, of Edinburgh, not very far from Algol. No star had been visible at that point before. Within twenty-four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone Capella. In a week or two it had visibly faded, and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye.\u201d\n"

There was naturally, therefore, a very widespread interest when it was announced one morning that the lady had absolutely and for ever taken the veil, and that the world would see her no more. When, at the very tail of this rumour, there came the assurance that the celebrated operating surgeon, the man of steel nerves, had been found in the morning by his valet, seated on one side of his bed, smiling pleasantly upon the universe, with both legs jammed into one side of his breeches and his great brain about as valuable as a cap full of porridge, the matter was strong enough to give quite a little thrill of interest to folk who had never hoped that their jaded nerves were capable of such a sensation.\nDouglas Stone in his prime was one of the most remarkable men in England. Indeed, he could hardly be said to have ever reached his prime, for he was but nine-and-thirty at the time of this little incident. Those who knew him best were aware that famous as he was as a surgeon, he might have succeeded with even greater rapidity in any of a dozen lines of life. He could have cut his way to fame as a soldier, struggled to it as an explorer, bullied for it in the courts, or built it out of stone and iron as an engineer. He was born to be great, for he could plan what another man dare not do, and he could do what another man dare not plan. In surgery none could follow him. His nerve, his judgement, his intuition, were things apart. Again and again his knife cut away death, but grazed the very springs of life in doing it, until his assistants were as white as the patient. His energy, his audacity, his full-blooded self-confidence - does not the memory of them still linger to the south of Marylebone Road and the north of Oxford Street?\nHis vices were as magnificent as his virtues, and infinitely more picturesque. Large as was his income, and it was the third largest of all professional men in London, it was far beneath the luxury of his living. Deep in his complex nature lay a rich vein of sensualism, at the sport of which he placed all the prizes of his life. The eye, the ear, the touch, the palate, all were his masters. The bouquet of old vintages, the scent of rare exotics, the curves and tints of the daintiest potteries of Europe, it was to these that the quick-running stream of gold was transformed. And then there came his sudden mad passion for Lady Sannox, when a single interview with two challenging glances and a whispered word set him ablaze. She was the loveliest woman in London and the only one to him. He was one of the handsomest men in London, but not the only one to her. She had a liking for new experiences, and was gracious to most men who wooed her. It may have been cause or it may have been effect that Lord Sannox looked fifty, though he was but six-and-thirty.\nHe was a quiet, silent, neutral-tinted man, this lord, with thin lips and heavy eyelids, much given to gardening, and full of home-like habits. He had at one time been fond of acting, had even rented a theatre in London, and on its boards had first seen Miss Marion Dawson, to whom he had offered his hand, his title, and the third of a county. Since his marriage his early hobby had become distasteful to him. Even in private theatricals it was no longer possible to persuade him to exercise the talent which he had often showed that he possessed. He was happier with a spud and a watering-can among his orchids and chrysanthemums.\nIt was quite an interesting problem whether he was absolutely devoid of sense, or miserably wanting in spirit. Did he know his lady\u2019s ways and condone them, or was he a mere blind, doting fool? It was a point to be discussed over the teacups in snug little drawing-rooms, or with the aid of a cigar in the bow windows of clubs. Bitter and plain were the comments among men upon his conduct. There was but one who had a good word to say for him, and he was the most silent member in the smoking-room. He had seen him break in a horse at the University, and it seemed to have left an impression upon his mind.\nBut when Douglas Stone became the favourite all doubts as to Lord Sannox\u2019s knowledge or ignorance were set for ever at rest. There was no subterfuge about Stone. In his high-handed, impetuous fashion, he set all caution and discretion at defiance. The scandal became notorious. A learned body intimated that his name had been struck from the list of its vice-presidents. Two friends implored him to consider his professional credit. He cursed them all three, and spent forty guineas on a bangle to take with him to the lady. He was at her house every evening, and she drove in his carriage in the afternoons. There was not an attempt on either side to conceal their relations; but there came at last a little incident to interrupt them.\nIt was a dismal winter\u2019s night, very cold and gusty, with the wind whooping in the chimneys and blustering against the window-panes. A thin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the gale, drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eaves. Douglas Stone had finished his dinner, and sat by his fire in the study, a glass of rich port upon the malachite table at his elbow. As he raised it to his lips, he held it up against the lamplight, and watched with the eye of a connoisseur the tiny scales of beeswing which floated in its rich ruby depths. The fire, as it spurted up, threw fitful lights upon his bald, clear-cut face, with its widely-opened grey eyes, its thick and yet firm lips, and the deep, square jaw, which had something Roman in its strength and its animalism. He smiled from time to time as he nestled back in his luxurious chair. Indeed, he had a right to feel well pleased, for, against the advice of six colleagues, he had performed an operation that day of which only two cases were on record, and the result had been brilliant beyond all expectation. No other man in London would have had the daring to plan, or the skill to execute, such a heroic measure.\nBut he had promised Lady Sannox to see her that evening and it was already half-past eight. His hand was outstretched to the bell to order the carriage when he heard the dull thud of the knocker. An instant later there was the shuffling of feet in the hall, and the sharp closing of a door.\n\u201cA patient to see you, sir, in the consulting room,\u201d said the butler.\n\u201cAbout himself?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir; I think he wants you to go out.\u201d\n\u201cIt is too late,\u201d cried Douglas Stone peevishly. \u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d\n\u201cThis is his card, sir.\u201d\nThe butler presented it upon the gold salver which had been given to his master by the wife of a Prime Minister.\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Hamil Ali, Smyrna.\u2019 Hum! The fellow is a Turk, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. He seems as if he came from abroad, sir. And he\u2019s in a terrible way.\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut! I have an engagement. I must go somewhere else. But I\u2019ll see him. Show him in here, Pim.\u201d\nA few moments later the butler swung open the door and ushered in a small and decrepit man, who walked with a bent back and with the forward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with extreme short sight. His face was swarthy, and his hair and beard of the deepest black. In one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red, in the other a small chamois-leather bag.\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Douglas Stone, when the butler had closed the door. \u201cYou speak English, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I am from Asia Minor, but I speak English when I speak slow.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanted me to go out, I understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I wanted very much that you should see my wife.\u201d\n\u201cI could come in the morning, but I have an engagement which prevents me from seeing your wife tonight.\u201d\nThe Turk\u2019s answer was a singular one. He pulled the string which closed the mouth of the chamois-leather bag, and poured a flood of gold on to the table.\n\u201cThere are one hundred pounds there,\u201d said he, \u201cand I promise you that it will not take you an hour. I have a cab ready at the door.\u201d\nDouglas Stone glanced at his watch. An hour would not make it too late to visit Lady Sannox. He had been there later. And the fee was an extraordinarily high one. He had been pressed by his creditors lately, and he could not afford to let such a chance pass. He would go.\n\u201cWhat is the case?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, it is so sad a one! So sad a one! You have not, perhaps heard of the daggers of the Almohades?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cAh, they are Eastern daggers of a great age and of a singular shape, with the hilt like what you call a stirrup. I am a curiosity dealer, you understand, and that is why I have come to England from Smyrna, but next week I go back once more. Many things I brought with me, and I have a few things left, but among them, to my sorrow, is one of these daggers.\u201d\n\u201cYou will remember that I have an appointment, sir,\u201d said the surgeon, with some irritation; \u201cpray confine yourself to the necessary details.\u201d\n\u201cYou will see that it is necessary. Today my wife fell down in a faint in the room in which I keep my wares, and she cut her lower lip upon this cursed dagger of Almohades.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Douglas Stone, rising. \u201cAnd you wish me to dress the wound?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it is worse than that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cThese daggers are poisoned.\u201d\n\u201cPoisoned!\u201d\n\u201cYes, and there is no man, East or West, who can tell now what is the poison or what the cure. But all that is known I know, for my father was in this trade before me, and we have had much to do with these poisoned weapons.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the symptoms?\u201d\n\u201cDeep sleep, and death in thirty hours.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you say there is no cure. Why then should you pay me this considerable fee?\u201d\n\u201cNo drug can cure, but the knife may.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\n\u201cThe poison is slow of absorption. It remains for hours in the wound.\u201d\n\u201cWashing, then, might cleanse it?\u201d\n\u201cNo more than in a snake bite. It is too subtle and too deadly.\u201d\n\u201cExcision of the wound, then?\u201d\n\u201cThat is it. If it be on the finger, take the finger off. So said my father always. But think of where this wound is, and that it is my wife. It is dreadful!\u201d\nBut familiarity with such grim matters may take the finer edge from a man\u2019s sympathy. To Douglas Stone this was already an interesting case, and he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble objections of the husband.\n\u201cIt appears to be that or nothing,\u201d said he brusquely. \u201cIt is better to loose a lip than a life.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I know that you are right. Well, well, it is kismet, and it must be faced. I have the cab, and you will come with me and do this thing.\u201d\nDouglas Stone took his case of bistouries from a drawer, and placed it with a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in his pocket. He must waste no more time if he were to see Lady Sannox.\n\u201cI am ready,\u201d said he, pulling on his overcoat. \u201cWill you take a glass of wine before you go out into this cold air?\u201d\nHis visitor shrank away, with a protesting hand upraised.\n\u201cYou forget that I am a Mussulman, and a true follower of the Prophet,\u201d said he. \u201cBut tell me what is the bottle of green glass which you have placed in your pocket?\u201d\n\u201cIt is chloroform.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that also is forbidden to us. It is a spirit, and we make no use of such things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! You would allow your wife to go through an operation without an anaesthetic?\u201d\n\u201cAh! she will feel nothing, poor soul. The deep sleep has already come on, which is the first working of the poison. And then I have given her of our Smyrna opium. Come, sir, for already an hour has passed.\u201d\nAs they stepped out into the darkness, a sheet of rain was driven in upon their faces, and the hall lamp, which dangled from the arm of a marble Caryatid, went out with a fluff. Pim, the butler, pushed the heavy door to, straining hard with his shoulder against the wind, while the two men groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed where the cab was waiting. An instant later they were rattling upon their journey.\n\u201cIs it far?\u201d asked Douglas Stone.\n\u201cOh, no. We have a very little quiet place off the Euston Road.\u201d\nThe surgeon pressed the spring of his repeater and listened to the little tings which told him the hour. It was a quarter past nine. He calculated the distances, and the short time which it would take him to perform so trivial an operation. He ought to reach Lady Sannox by ten o\u2019clock. Through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gas lamps dancing past, with occasionally the broader glare of a shop front. The rain was pelting and rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage, and the wheels swashed as they rolled through puddle and mud. Opposite to him the white headgear of his companion gleamed faintly through the obscurity. The surgeon felt in his pockets and arranged his needles, his ligatures and his safety-pins, that no time might be wasted when they arrived. He chafed with impatience and drummed his foot upon the floor.\nBut the cab slowed down at last and pulled up. In an instant Douglas Stone was out, and the Smyrna merchant\u2019s toe was at his very heel.\n\u201cYou can wait,\u201d said he to the driver.\nIt was a mean-looking house in a narrow and sordid street. The surgeon, who knew his London well, cast a swift glance into the shadows, but there was nothing distinctive - no shop, no movement, nothing but a double line of dull, flat-faced houses, a double stretch of wet flagstones which gleamed in the lamplight, and a double rush of water in the gutters which swirled and gurgled towards the sewer gratings. The door which faced them was blotched and discoloured, and a faint light in the fan pane above, it served to show the dust and the grime which covered it. Above in one of the bedroom windows, there was a dull yellow glimmer. The merchant knocked loudly, and, as he turned his dark face towards the light, Douglas Stone could see that it was contracted with anxiety. A bolt was drawn, and an elderly woman with a taper stood in the doorway, shielding the thin flame with her gnarled hand.\n\u201cIs all well?\u201d gasped the merchant.\n\u201cShe is as you left her, sir.\u201d\n\u201cShe has not spoken?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she is in a deep sleep.\u201d\nThe merchant closed the door, and Douglas Stone walked down the narrow passage, glancing about him in some surprise as he did so. There was no oil-cloth, no mat, no hat-rack. Deep grey dust and heavy festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere. Following the old woman up the winding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent house. There was no carpet.\nThe bedroom was on the second landing. Douglas Stone followed the old nurse into it, with the merchant at his heels. Here, at least, there was furniture and to spare. The floor was littered and the corners piled with Turkish cabinets, inlaid tables, coats of chain mail, strange pipes, and grotesque weapons. A single small lamp stood upon a bracket on the wall. Douglas Stone took it down, and picking his way among the lumber, walked over to a couch in the corner, on which lay a woman dressed in the Turkish fashion, with yashmak and veil. The lower part of the face was exposed, and the surgeon saw a jagged cut which zigzagged along the border of the under lip.\n\u201cYou will forgive the yashmak,\u201d said the Turk. \u201cYou know our views about women in the East.\u201d\nBut the surgeon was not thinking about the yashmak. This was no longer a woman to him. It was a case. He stooped and examined the wound carefully.\n\u201cThere are no signs of irritation,\u201d said he. \u201cWe might delay the operation until local symptoms develop.\u201d\nThe husband wrung his hands in uncontrollable agitation.\n\u201cOh! sir, sir,\u201d he cried. \u201cDo not trifle. You do not know. It is deadly. I know, and I give you my assurance that an operation is absolutely necessary. Only the knife can save her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet I am inclined to wait,\u201d said Douglas Stone.\n\u201cThat is enough,\u201d the Turk cried, angrily. \u201cEvery minute is of importance, and I cannot stand here and see my wife allowed to sink. It only remains for me to give you my thanks for having come, and to call in some other surgeon before it is too late.\u201d\nDouglas Stone hesitated. To refund that hundred pounds was no pleasant matter. But of course if he left the case he must return the money. And if the Turk were right and the woman died, his position before a coroner might be an embarrassing one.\n\u201cYou have had personal experience of this poison?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI have.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you assure me that an operation is needful.\u201d\n\u201cI swear it by all that I hold sacred.\u201d\n\u201cThe disfigurement will be frightful.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand that the mouth will not be a pretty one to kiss.\u201d\nDouglas Stone turned fiercely upon the man. The speech was a brutal one. But the Turk has his own fashion of talk and of thought, and there was no time for wrangling. Douglas Stone drew a bistoury from his case, opened it and felt the keen straight edge with his forefinger. Then he held the lamp closer to the bed. Two dark eyes were gazing up at him through the slit in the yashmak. They were all iris, and the pupil was hardly to be seen.\n\u201cYou have given her a very heavy dose of opium.\u201d\n\u201cYes, she has had a good dose.\u201d\nHe glanced again at the dark eyes which looked straight at his own. They were dull and lustreless, but, even as he gazed, a little shifting sparkle came into them, and the lips quivered.\n\u201cShe is not absolutely unconscious,\u201d said he.\n\u201cWould it not be well to use the knife while it will be painless?\u201d\nThe same thought had crossed the surgeon\u2019s mind. He grasped the wounded lip with his forceps, and with two swift cuts he took out a broad V-shaped piece. The woman sprang up on the couch with a dreadful gurgling scream. Her covering was torn from her face. It was a face that he knew. In spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber of blood, it was a face that he knew. She kept on putting her hand up to the gap and screaming. Douglas Stone sat down at the foot of the couch with his knife and his forceps. The room was whirling round, and he had felt something go like a ripping seam behind his ear. A bystander would have said that his face was the more ghastly of the two. As in a dream, or as if he had been looking at something at the play, he was conscious that the Turk\u2019s hair and beard lay upon the table, and that Lord Sannox was leaning against the wall with his hand to his side, laughing silently. The screams had died away now, and the dreadful head had dropped back again upon the pillow, but Douglas Stone still sat motionless, and Lord Sannox still chuckled quietly to himself.\n\u201cIt was really very necessary for Marion, this operation,\u201d said he, \u201cnot physically, but morally, you know, morally.\u201d\nDouglas Stone stooped for yards and began to play with the fringe of the coverlet. His knife tinkled down upon the ground, but he still held the forceps and something more.\n\u201cI had long intended to make a little example,\u201d said Lord Sannox, suavely. \u201cYour note of Wednesday miscarried, and I have it here in my pocket-book. I took some pains in carrying out my idea. The wound, by the way, was from nothing more dangerous than my signet ring.\u201d\nHe glanced keenly at his silent companion, and cocked the small revolver which he held in his coat pocket. But Douglas Stone was still picking at the coverlet.\n\u201cYou see you have kept your appointment after all,\u201d said Lord Sannox.\nAnd at that Douglas Stone began to laugh. He laughed long and loudly. But Lord Sannox did not laugh now. Something like fear sharpened and hardened his features. He walked from the room, and he walked on tiptoe. The old woman was waiting outside.\n\u201cAttend to your mistress when she awakes,\u201d said Lord Sannox.\nThen he went down to the street. The cab was at the door, and the driver raised his hand to his hat.\n\u201cJohn,\u201d said Lord Sannox, \u201cyou will take the doctor home first. He will want leading downstairs, I think. Tell his butler that he has been taken ill at a case.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen you can take Lady Sannox home.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how about yourself, sir?\u201d\n\u201cOh, my address for the next few months will be Hotel di Roma, Venice. Just see that the letters are sent on. And tell Stevens to exhibit all the purple chrysanthemums next Monday, and to wire me the result.\u201d\n"

                "content": "\nI was shewn into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man with quiet clothes and an iron-grey beard, who spoke to me in this fashion:\n\u201cYes, he lived here\u2014but I don\u2019t advise your doing anything. Your curiosity makes you irresponsible. We never come here at night, and it\u2019s only because of his will that we keep it this way. You know what he did. That abominable society took charge at last, and we don\u2019t know where he is buried. There was no way the law or anything else could reach the society.\n\u201cI hope you won\u2019t stay till after dark. And I beg of you to let that thing on the table\u2014the thing that looks like a match box\u2014alone. We don\u2019t know what it is, but we suspect it has something to do with what he did. We even avoid looking at it very steadily.\u201d\nAfter a time the man left me alone in the attic room. It was very dingy and dusty, and only primitively furnished, but it had a neatness which shewed it was not a slum-denizen\u2019s quarters. There were shelves full of theological and classical books, and another bookcase containing treatises on magic\u2014Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes Trismegistus, Borellus, and others in strange alphabets whose titles I could not decipher. The furniture was very plain. There was a door, but it led only into a closet. The only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude, steep staircase led. The windows were of bull\u2019s-eye pattern, and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity. Plainly, this house was of the old world. I seemed to know where I was, but cannot recall what I then knew. Certainly the town was not London. My impression is of a small seaport.\nThe small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light\u2014or what looked like one\u2014out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes. The light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some radio-active bombardment. I recall that I did not regard it as a common flashlight\u2014indeed, I had a common flashlight in another pocket.\nIt was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked very queer through the bull\u2019s-eye window-panes. Finally I summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book\u2014then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it. The light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a continuous beam. As the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange device, they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed. The dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow, and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its centre. Then I noticed that I was not alone in the room\u2014and put the ray-projector back in my pocket.\nBut the newcomer did not speak\u2014nor did I hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy pantomime, as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze\u2014although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close, as if both near and distant, according to some abnormal geometry.\nThe newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty years old, with a sallow, olive complexion and fairly good features, but an abnormally high forehead. His black hair was well cut and neatly brushed, and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard. He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows. His build and lower facial features were like other clergymen I had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent-looking\u2014also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking. At the present moment\u2014having just lighted a faint oil lamp\u2014he looked nervous, and before I knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted sharply) which I had not noticed before. The flames devoured the volumes greedily\u2014leaping up in strange colours and emitting indescribably hideous odours as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element. All at once I saw there were others in the room\u2014grave-looking men in clerical costume, one of whom wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop. Though I could hear nothing, I could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the first-comer. They seemed to hate and fear him at the same time, and he seemed to return these sentiments. His face set itself into a grim expression, but I could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair. The bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down amidst a charred, non-committal mass), and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing. The first-comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table. Everyone then seemed frightened. The procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trap-door in the floor, turning and making menacing gestures as they left. The bishop was last to go.\nThe first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope. Mounting a chair, he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak, and began making a noose with the other end. Realising he was about to hang himself, I started forward to dissuade or save him. He saw me and ceased his preparations, looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me. He slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark, thin-lipped face.\nI felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of defence. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I turned it on\u2014full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear\u2014which did not, however, wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in his tracks\u2014then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backward. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor, and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view.\nI found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I had not heard? Presently the two people (simply villagers, apparently) farthest in the lead saw me\u2014and stood paralysed. One of them shrieked loudly and reverberently:\n\u201cAhrrh! . . . It be \u2018ee, zur? Again?\u201d\nThen they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place\u2014standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic. He spoke:\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t let it alone! I\u2019m sorry. I know what has happened. It happened once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You ought not to have made him come back. You know what he wants. But you mustn\u2019t get frightened like the other man he got. Something very strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn\u2019t get far enough to hurt your mind and personality. If you\u2019ll keep cool, and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship. But you can\u2019t live here\u2014and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll wish to go back to London. I\u2019d advise America.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t try anything more with that\u2014thing. Nothing can be put back now. It would only make matters worse to do\u2014or summon\u2014anything. You are not as badly off as you might be\u2014but you must get out of here at once and stay away. You\u2019d better thank heaven it didn\u2019t go further. . . .\n\u201cI\u2019m going to prepare you as bluntly as I can. There\u2019s been a certain change\u2014in your personal appearance. He always causes that. But in a new country you can get used to it. There\u2019s a mirror up at the other end of the room, and I\u2019m going to take you to it. You\u2019ll get a shock\u2014though you will see nothing repulsive.\u201d\nI was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp (i.e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had brought) in his free hand. This is what I saw in the glass:\nA thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height.\nIt was the silent first-comer who had burned his books.\nFor all the rest of my life, in outward form, I was to be that man!\n"

                "content": "\nMy name is Pharpetron, among those who have known me in Poseidonis; but even I, the last and most forward pupil of the wise Avyctes, know not the name of that which I am fated to become ere to-morrow. Therefore, by the ebbing silver lamps, in my master\u2019s marble house above the loud, ever-ravening sea, I write this tale with a hasty hand, scrawling an ink of wizard virtue on the grey, priceless, antique parchment of dragons. And having written, I shall enclose the pages in a sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and shall cast the cylinder from a high window into the sea, lest that which I am doomed to become should haply destroy the writing. And it may be that mariners from Lephara, passing to Umb and Pneor in their tall triremes, will find the cylinder; or fishers will draw it from the wave in their seines of byssus; and having read my story, men will learn the truth and take warning; and no man\u2019s feet, henceforward, will approach the pale and demon-haunted house of Avyctes.\nFor six years, I have dwelt apart with the aged master, forgetting youth and its wonted desires in the study of arcanic things. Together, we have delved more deeply than all others before us in an interdicted lore; we have solved the keyless hieroglyphs that guard ante-human formulae; we have talked with the prehistoric dead; we have called up the dwellers in sealed crypts, in fearful abysses beyond space. Few are the sons of mankind who have cared to seek us out among the desolate, wind-worn crags; and many, but nameless, are the visitants who have come to us from further bourns of place and time.\nStern and white as a tomb, older than the memory of the dead, and built by men or devils beyond the recording of myth, is the mansion in which we dwell. Far below, on black, naked reefs, the northern sea climbs and roars indomitably, or ebbs with a ceaseless murmur as of armies of baffled demons; and the house is filled evermore, like a hollow-sounding sepulcher, with the drear echo of its tumultuous voices; and the winds wail in dismal wrath around the high towers, but shake them not. On the seaward side, the mansion rises sheerly from the straight-falling cliff; but on the other sides there are narrow terraces, grown with dwarfish, crooked cedars that bow always beneath the gale. Giant marble monsters guard the landward portals; and huge marble women ward the strait porticoes above the sea; and mighty statues and mummies stand everywhere in the chambers and along the halls. But, saving these, and the spirits we have summoned, there is none to companion us; and liches and shadows have been the servitors of our daily needs.\nAll men have heard the fame of Avyctes, the sole surviving pupil of that Malygris who tyrannized in his necromancy over Susran from a tower of sable stone; Malygris, who lay dead for years while men believed him living; who, lying thus, still uttered potent spells and dire oracles with decaying lips. But Avyctes lusted not for temporal power in the manner of Malygris; and having learned all that the elder sorcerer could teach him, withdrew from the cities of Poseidonis to seek another and vaster dominion; and I, the youth Pharpetron, in the latter years of Avyctes, was permitted to join him in this solitude; and since then, I have shared his austerities and vigils and evocations . . . and now, likewise, I must share the weird doom that has come in answer to his summoning.\nNot without terror (since man is but mortal) did I, the neophyte, behold at first the abhorrent and tremendous faces of them that obeyed Avyctes: the genii of the sea and earth, of the stars and the heavens, who passed to and fro in his marmorean halls. I shuddered at the black writhing of submundane things from the many-volumed smoke of the braziers; I cried in horror at the grey foulnesses, colossal, without form, that crowded malignly about the drawn circle of seven colors, threatening unspeakable trespass on us that stood at the center. Not without revulsion did I drink wine that was poured by cadavers, and eat bread that was purveyed by phantoms. But use and custom dulled the strangeness, destroyed the fear; and in time I believed implicitly that Avyctes was the lord of all incantations and exorcisms, with infallible power to dismiss the beings he evoked.\nWell had it had been for Avyctes\u2014 and for me\u2014 if the master had contented himself with the lore preserved from Atlantis and Thule, or brought over from Mu and Mayapan. Surely this should have been enough: for in the ivory-sheeted books of Thule there were blood-writ runes that would call the demons of the fifth and seventh planets, if spoken aloud at the hour of their ascent; and the sorcerers of Mu had left record of a process whereby the doors of far-future time could be unlocked; and our fathers, the Atlanteans, had known the road between the atoms and the path into far stars, and had held speech with the spirits of the sun. But Avyctes thirsted for a darker knowledge, a deeper empery; and into his hands, in the third year of my novitiate, there came the mirror-bright tablet of the lost serpent-people.\nStrange, and apparently fortuitous, was our finding of the tablet. At certain hours, when the tide had fallen from the steep rocks, we were wont to descend by cavern-hidden stairs to a cliff-walled crescent beach behind the promontory on which stood the house of Avyctes. There, on the dun, wet sands, beyond the foamy tongues of the surf, would lie the worn and curious driftage of alien shores, and trove that hurricanes had cast up from unsounded deeps. And there we had found the purple and sanguine volutes of great shells, and rude lumps of ambergris, and white flowers of perpetually blooming coral; and once, the barbaric idol of green brass that had been the figurehead of a galley from far hyperboreal isles.\nThere had been a great storm, such as must have riven the sea to its nethermost profound; but the tempest had gone by with morning, and the heavens were cloudless on that fatal day when we found the tablet, and the demon winds were hushed among the high crags and chasms; and the sea lisped with a low whisper, like the rustle of gowns of samite trailed by fleeing maidens on the sand. And just beyond the ebbing wave, in a tangle of russet sea-weed, we beheld a thing that glittered with blinding sun-like brilliance. And running forward, I plucked it from the wrack before the wave\u2019s return, and bore it to Avyctes.\nThe tablet was wrought of some nameless metal, like never-rusting iron, but heavier. It had the form of a triangle and was broader at the widest than a man\u2019s heart. On one side it was wholly blank; and Avyctes and I, in turn, beheld our features mirrored strangely, like the drawn, pallid features of the dead, in its burnished surface. On the other side many rows of small crooked ciphers were incised deeply in the metal, as if by the action of some mordant acid; and these ciphers were not the pictorial symbols or alphabetic characters of any language known to the master or to me.\nOf the tablet\u2019s age and origin, likewise, we could form no conjecture; and our erudition was altogether baffled. For many days thereafter we studied the writing and held argument that came to no issue. And night by night, in a high chamber closed against the perennial winds, we pondered over the dazzling triangle by the tall straight flames of silver lamps. For Avyctes deemed that knowledge of rare value (or haply some secret of an alien or elder magic) was holden by the clueless crooked ciphers. Then, since all our scholarship was in vain, the master sought another divination, and had recourse to wizardy and necromancy. But at first, among the devils and phantoms that answered our interrogation, none could tell us aught concerning the tablet. And any other than Avyctes would have despaired in the end . . . and well would it have been if he had despaired, and had sought no longer to decipher the writing ....\nThe months and years went by with a slow thundering of seas on the dark rocks, and a headlong clamor of winds around the white towers. Still we continued our delvings and evocations; and further, always further we went into lampless realms of space and spirit; learning, perchance, to unlock the hithermost of the manifold infinities. And at whiles, Avyctes would resume his pondering of the sea-found tablet; or would question some visitant from other spheres of time and place regarding its interpretation.\nAt last, by the use of a chance formula, in idle experiment, he summoned up the dim, tenuous ghost of a sorcerer from prehistoric years; and the ghost, in a thin whisper of uncouth, forgotten speech, informed us that the letters on the tablet were those of a language of the serpent-men, whose primordial continent had sunk aeons before the lifting of Hyperborea from the ooze. But the ghost could tell us naught of their significance; for, even in his time, the serpent-people had become a dubious legend; and their deep, ante-human lore and sorcery were things irretrievable by man.\nNow, in all the books of conjuration owned by Avyctes, there was no spell whereby we could call the lost serpent-men from their fabulous epoch. But there was an old Lemurian formula, recondite and uncertain, by which the shadow of a dead man could be sent into years posterior to those of his own life-time, and could be recalled after an interim by the wizard. And the shade, being wholly insubstantial, would suffer no harm from the temporal transition, and would remember, for the information of the wizard, that which he had been instructed to learn during the journey.\nSo, having called again the ghost of the prehistoric sorcerer, whose name was Ybith, Avyctes made a singular use of several very ardent gums and combustible fragments of fossil wood; and he and I, reciting the responses to the formula, sent the thin spirit of Ybith into the far ages of the serpent-men. And after a time which the master deemed sufficient, we performed the curious rites of incantation that would recall Ybith from his alienage. And the rites were successful; and Ybith stood before us again, like a blown vapor that is nigh to vanishing. And in words that were faint as the last echo of perishing memories, the specter told us the key to the meaning of the letters, which he had learned in the primeval past; and after this, we questioned Ybith no more, but suffered him to return unto slumber and oblivion.\nThen, knowing the import of the tiny, twisted ciphers, we read the writing on the tablet and made thereof a transliteration, though not without labor and difficulty, since the very phonetics of the serpent tongue, and the symbols and ideas expressed in the writing, were somewhat alien to those of mankind. And when we had mastered the inscription, we found that it contained the formula for a certain evocation which, no doubt, had been used by the serpent sorcerers. But the object of the evocation was not named; nor was there any clue to the nature or identity of that which would come in answer to the rites. And moreover there was no corresponding rite of exorcism nor spell of dismissal.\nGreat was the jubilation of Avyctes, deeming that we had learned a lore beyond the memory or prevision of man. And though I sought to dissuade him, he resolved to employ the evocation, arguing that our discovery was no chance thing but was fatefully predestined from the beginning. And he seemed to think lightly of the menace that might be brought upon us by the conjuration of things whose nativity and attributes were wholly obscure. \u201cFor,\u201d said Avyctes, \u201cI have called up, in all the years of my sorcery, no god or devil, no demon or lich or shadow, which I could not control and dismiss at will. And I am loath to believe that any power or spirit beyond the subversion of my spells could have been summoned by a race of serpents, whatever their skill in demonism and necromancy.\u201d\nSo, seeing that he was obstinate, and acknowledging him for my master in all ways, I consented to aid Avyctes in the experiment, though not without dire misgivings. And then we gathered together, in the chamber of conjuration, at the specified hour and configuration of the stars, the equivalents of sundry rare materials that the tablet had instructed us to use in the ritual.\nOf much that we did, and of certain agents that we employed, it were better not to tell; nor shall I record the shrill, sibilant words, difficult for beings not born of serpents to articulate, whose intonation formed a signal part of the ceremony. Toward the last, we drew a triangle on the marble floor with the fresh blood of birds; and Avyctes stood at one angle, and I at another; and the gaunt umber mummy of an Atlantean warrior, whose name had been Oigos, was stationed at the third angle. And standing thus, Avyctes and I held tapers of corpse-tallow in our hands, till the tapers had burned down between our fingers as into a socket. And in the outstretched palms of the mummy of Oigos, as if in shallow thuribles, talc and asbestos burned, ignited by a strange fire whereof we knew the secret. At one side we had traced on the floor an infrangible ellipse, made by an endless linked repetition of the twelve unspeakable Signs of Oumor, to which we could retire if the visitant should prove inimical or rebellious. We waited while the pole-circling stars went over, as had been prescribed. Then, when the tapers had gone out between our seared fingers, and the talc and asbestos were wholly consumed in the mummy\u2019s eaten palms, Avyctes uttered a single word whose sense was obscure to us; and Oigos, being animated by sorcery and subject to our will, repeated the word after a given interval, in tones that were hollow as a tomb-born echo; and I in my turn also repeated it.\nNow, in the chamber of evocation, before beginning the ritual, we had opened a small window giving upon the sea, and had likewise left open a high door on the hall to landward, lest that which came in answer to us should require a spatial mode of entrance. And during the ceremony, the sea became still and there was no wind, and it seemed that all things were hushed in awful expectation of the nameless visitor. But after all was done, and the last word had been repeated by Oigos and me, we stood and waited vainly for a visible sign or other manifestation. The lamps burned stilly in the midnight room; and no shadows fell, other than were cast by ourselves and Oigos and by the great marble women along the walls. And in the magic mirrors we had placed cunningly, to reflect those that were otherwise unseen, we beheld no breath or trace of any image.\nAt this, after a reasonable interim, Avyctes was sorely disappointed, deeming that the evocation had failed of its purpose; and I, having the same thought, was secretly relieved. And we questioned the mummy of Oigos, to learn if he had perceived in the room, with such senses as are peculiar to the dead, the sure token or doubtful proof of a presence undescried by us the living. And the mummy gave a necromantic answer, saying that there was nothing.\n\u201cVerily,\u201d said Avyctes, \u201cit were useless to wait longer. For surely in some way we have misunderstood the purport of the writing, or have failed to duplicate the matters used in the evocation, or the correct intonement of the words. Or it may be that in the lapse of so many aeons, the thing that was formerly wont to respond has long ceased to exist, or has altered in its attributes so that the spell is now void and valueless.\u201d To this I assented readily, hoping that the matter was at an end. So, after erasing the blood-marked triangle and the sacred ellipse of the linked Signs of Oumor, and after dismissing Oigos to his wonted place among other mummies, we retired to sleep. And in the days that followed, we resumed our habitual studies, but made no mention to each other of the strange triangular tablet or the vain formula.\nEven as before, our days went on; and the sea climbed and roared in white fury on the cliffs, and the winds wailed by in their unseen, sullen wrath, bowing the dark cedars as witches are bowed by the breath of Taaran, god of evil. Almost, in the marvel of new tests and cantraips, I forgot the ineffectual conjuration, and I deemed that Avyctes had also forgotten it.\nAll things were as of yore, to our sorcerous perception; and there was naught to trouble us in our wisdom and power and serenity, which we deemed secure above the sovereignty of kings. Reading the horoscopic stars, we found no future ill in their aspect; nor was any shadow of bale foreshown to us through geomancy, or other modes of divination such as we employed. And our familiars, though grisly and dreadful to mortal gaze, were wholly obedient to us the masters.\nThen, on a clear summer afternoon, we walked, as was often our custom, on the marble terrace behind the house. In robes of ocean-purple, we paced among the windy trees with their blown, crooked shadows; and there, following us as we went to and fro, I saw the blue shadow of Avyctes and my own shadow on the marble; and between them, an adumbration that was not wrought by any of the cedars. And I was greatly startled, but spoke not of the matter to Avyctes, and observed the unknown shadow with covert care.\nI saw that it followed closely the shadow of Avyctes, keeping ever the same distance. And it fluttered not in the wind, but moved with a flowing as of some heavy, thick, putrescent liquid; and its color was not blue nor purple nor black, nor any other hue to which man\u2019s eyes are habituated, but a hue as of some unearthly purulence; and its form was altogether monstrous, having a squat head and a long, undulant body, without similitude to beast or devil.\nAvyctes heeded not the shadow; and still I feared to speak, though I thought it an ill thing for the master to be companioned thus. And I moved closer to him, in order to detect by touch or other perception the invisible presence that had cast the adumbration. But the air was void to sunward of the shadow; and I found nothing opposite the sun nor in any oblique direction, though I searched closely, knowing that certain beings cast their shadows thus.\nAfter a while, at the customary hour, we returned by the coiling stairs and monster-flanked portals into the high house. And I saw that the strange adumbration moved ever behind the shadow of Avyctes, falling horrible and unbroken on the steps and passing clearly separate and distinct amid the long umbrages of the towering monsters. And in the dim halls beyond the sun, where shadows should not have been, I beheld with terror the distorted loathly blot, having a pestilent, unnamable hue, that followed Avyctes as if in lieu of his own extinguished shadow. And all that day, everywhere that we went, at the table served by specters, or in the mummy-warded room of volumes and books, the thing pursued Avyctes, clinging to him even as leprosy to the leper. And still the master had perceived it not; and still I forbore to warn him, hoping that the visitant would withdraw in its own time, going obscurely as it had come.\nBut at midnight, when we sat together by the silver lamps, pondering the blood-writ runes of Hyperborea, I saw that the shadow had drawn closer to the shadow of Avyctes, towering behind his chair on the wall between the huge sculptured women and the mummies. And the thing was a streaming ooze of charnel pollution, a foulness beyond the black leprosies of hell; and I could bear it no more; and I cried out in my fear and loathing, and informed the master of its presence.\nBeholding now the shadow, Avyctes considered it closesly and in silence; and there was neither fear nor awe nor abhorrence in the deep, graven wrinkles of his visage. And he said to me at last:\n\u201cThis thing is a mystery beyond my lore; but never, in all the practice of my art, has any shadow come to me unbidden. And since all others of our evocations have found answer ere this, I must deem that the shadow is a veritable entity, or the sign of an entity, that has come in belated response to the formula of the serpent-sorcerers, which we thought powerless and void. And I think it well that we should now repair to the chamber of conjuration, and interrogate the shadow in such manner as we may, to inquire its nativity and purpose.\u201d\nWe went forthwith into the chamber of conjuration, and made such preparations as were both necessary and possible. And when we were prepared to question it, the unknown shadow had drawn closer still to the shadow of Avyctes, so that the clear space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a necromancer\u2019s rod.\nNow, in all ways that were feasible, we interrogated the shadow, speaking through our own lips and the lips of mummies and statues. But there was no determinable answer; and calling certain of the devils and phantoms that were our familiars, we made question through the mouths of these, but without result. And all the while, our magic mirrors were void of any reflection of a presence that might have cast the shadow; and they that had been our spokesmen could detect nothing in the room. And there was no spell, it seemed, that had power upon the visitant. So Avyctes became troubled; and drawing on the floor with blood and ashes the ellipse of Oumor, wherein no demon nor spirit may intrude, he retired to its center. But still within the ellipse, like a flowing taint of liquid corruption, the shadow followed his shadow; and the space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a wizard\u2019s pen.\nNow, on the face of Avyctes, horror had graven new wrinkles; and his brow was beaded with a deathly sweat. For he knew, even as I, that this was a thing beyond all laws, and foreboding naught but disaster and evil. And he cried to me in a shaken voice, and said:\n\u201cI have no knowledge of this thing nor its intention toward me, and no power to stay its progress. Go forth and leave me now; for I would not that any man should witness the defeat of my sorcery and the doom that may follow thereupon. Also, it were well to depart while there is time, lest you too should become the quarry of the shadow and be compelled to share its menace.\u201d\nThough terror had fastened upon my inmost soul, I was loath to leave Avyctes. But I had sworn to obey his will at all times and in every respect; and moreover I knew myself doubly powerless against the adumbration, since Avyctes himself was impotent.\nSo, bidding him farewell, I went forth with trembling limbs from the haunted chamber; and peering back from the threshold, I saw that the alien umbrage, creeping like a noisome blotch on the floor, had touched the shadow of Avyctes. And at that moment the master shrieked aloud like one in nightmare; and his face was no longer the face of Avyctes but was contorted and convulsed like that of some helpless madman who wrestles with an unseen incubus. And I looked no more, but fled along the dim outer hall and through the high portals giving upon the terrace.\nA red moon, ominous and gibbous, had declined above the terrace and the crags; and the shadows of the cedars were elongated in the moon; and they wavered in the gale like the blown cloaks of enchanters. And stooping against the gale, I fled across the terrace toward the outer stairs that led to a steep path in the riven waste of rocks and chasms behind Avyctes\u2019 house. I neared the terrace edge, running with the speed of fear; but I could not reach the topmost outer stair; for at every step the marble flowed beneath me, fleeing like a pale horizon before the seeker. And though I raced and panted without pause, I could draw no nearer to the terrace edge.\nAt length I desisted, seeing that an unknown spell had altered the very space about the house of Avyctes, so that none could escape therefrom to landward. So, resigning myself in despair to whatever might befall, I returned toward the house. And climbing the white stairs in the low, level beams of the crag-caught moon, I saw a figure that awaited me in the portals. And I knew by the trailing robe of sea-purple, but by no other token, that the figure was Avyctes. For the face was no longer in its entirety the face of man, but was become a loathly fluid amalgam of human features with a thing not to be identified on earth. The transfiguration was ghastlier than death or the changes of decay; and the face was already hued with the nameless, corrupt and purulent color of the strange shadow, and had taken on, in respect to its outlines, a partial likeness to the squat profile of the shadow. The hands of the figure were not those of any terrene being; and the shape beneath the robe had lengthened with a nauseous undulant pliancy; and the face and fingers seemed to drip in the moon-light with a deliquescent corruption. And the pursuing umbrage, like a thickly flowing blight, had corroded and distorted the very shadow of Avyctes, which was now double in a manner not to be narrated here.\nFain would I have cried or spoken aloud; but horror had dried up the fount of speech. And the thing that had been Avyctes beckoned me in silence, uttering no word from its living and putrescent lips. And with eyes that were no longer eyes, but had become an oozing abomination, it peered steadily upon me. And it clutched my shoulder closely with the soft leprosy of its fingers, and led me half-swooning with revulsion along the hall, and into that room where the mummy of Oigos, who had assisted us in the threefold incantation of the serpent-men, was stationed with several of his fellows.\nBy the lamps which illumed the chamber, burning with pale, still, perpetual flames, I saw that the mummies stood erect along the wall in their exanimate repose, each in his wonted place with his tall shadow beside him. But the great, gaunt shadow of Oigos on the marble wall was companioned by an adumbration similar in all respects to the evil thing that had followed the master and was now incorporate with him. I remembered that Oigos had performed his share of the ritual, and had repeated an unknown stated word in turn after Avyctes; and so I knew that the horror had come to Oigos in turn, and would wreak itself upon the dead even as on the living. For the foul, anonymous thing that we had called in our presumption could manifest itself to mortal ken in no other way than this. We had drawn it from unfathomable depths of time and space, using ignorantly a dire formula; and the thing had come at its own chosen hour, to stamp itself in abomination uttermost on the evocators.\nSince then, the night has ebbed away, and a second day has gone by like a sluggish ooze of horror. . . . I have seen the complete identification of the shadow with the flesh and the shadow of Avyctes . . . and also I have seen the slow encroachment of that other umbrage, mingling itself with the lank shadow and the sere, bituminous body of Oigos, and turning them to a similitude of the thing which Avyctes has become. And I have heard the mummy cry out like a living man in great pain and fear, as with the throes of a second dissolution, at the impingement of the shadow. And long since it has grown silent, like the other horror, and I know not its thoughts or its intent. . . . And verily I know not if the thing that has come to us be one or several; nor if its avatar will rest complete with the three that summoned it forth into time, or be extended to others.\nBut these things, and much else, I shall soon know; for now, in turn, there is a shadow that follows mine, drawing ever closer. The air congeals and curdles with an unseen fear; and they that were our familiars have fled from the mansion; and the great marble women seem to tremble where they stand along the walls. But the horror that was Avyctes, and the second horror that was Oigos, have left me not, and neither do they tremble. And with eyes that are not eyes, they seem to brood and watch, waiting till I too shall become as they. And their stillness is more terrible than if they had rended me limb from limb. And there are strange voices in the wind, and alien roarings upon the sea; and the walls quiver like a thin veil in the black breath of remote abysses.\nSo, knowing that the time is brief, I have shut myself in the room of volumes and books and have written this account. And I have taken the bright triangular tablet, whose solution was our undoing, and have cast it from the window into the sea, hoping that none will find it after us. And now I must make an end, and enclose this writing in the sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and fling it forth to drift upon the wave. For the space between my shadow and the shadow of the horror is straitened momently. . . . and the space is no wider than the thickness of a wizard\u2019s pen.\n"

                "content": "\nOn Zothique, the last continent on Earth, the sun no longer shone with the whiteness of its prime, but was dim and tarnished as if with a vapor of blood. New stars without number had declared themselves in the heavens, and the shadows of the infinite had fallen closer. And out of the shadows, the older gods had returned to man: the gods forgotten since Hyperborea, since Mu and Poseidonis, bearing other names but the same attributes. And the elder demons had also returned, battening on the fumes of evil sacrifice, and fostering again the primordial sorceries.\nMany were the necromancers and magicians of Zothique, and the infamy and marvel of their doings were legended everywhere in the latter days. But among them all there was none greater than Namirrha, who imposed his black yoke on the cities of Xylac, and later, in a proud delirium, deemed himself the veritable peer of Thasaidon, lord of Evil.\nNamirrha had built his abode in Ummaos, the chief town of Xylac, to which he came from the desert realm of Tasuun with the dark renown of his thaumaturgies like a cloud of desert storm behind him. And no man knew that in coming to Ummaos he returned to the city of his birth; for all deemed him a native of Tasuun. Indeed, none could have dreamt that the great sorcerer was one with the beggar-boy Narthos, an orphan of questionable parentage, who had begged his daily bread in the streets and bazaars of Ummaos. Wretchedly had he lived, alone and despised; and a hatred of the cruel, opulent city grew in his heart like a smothered flame that feeds in secret, biding the time when it shall become a conflagration consuming all things.\nBitterer always, through his boyhood and early youth, was the spleen and rancor of Narthos toward men. And one day the prince Zotulla, a boy but little older than he, riding a restive palfrey, came upon him in the square before the imperial palace; and Narthos implored an alms. But Zotulla, scorning his plea, rode arrogantly forward, spurring the palfrey; and Narthos was ridden down and trampled under its hooves. And afterward, nigh to death from the trampling, he lay senseless for many hours, while the people passed him by unheeding. And at last, regaining his senses, he dragged himself to his hovel; but he limped a little thereafter all his days, and the mark of one hoof remained like a brand on his body, fading never. Later, he left Ummaos, and was forgotten quickly by its people. Going southward into Tasuun, he lost his way in the great desert, and was near to perishing. But finally he came to a small oasis, where dwelt the wizard Ouphaloc, a hermit who preferred the company of honest jackals and hyenas to that of men. And Ouphaloc, seeing the great craft and evil in the starveling boy, gave succor to Narthos and sheltered him. He dwelt for years with Ouphaloc, becoming the wizard\u2019s pupil and the heir of his demon-wrested lore. Strange things he learned in that hermitage, being fed on fruits and grain that had sprung not from the watered earth, and wine that was not the juice of terrene grapes. And like Ouphaloc, he became a master in devildom and drove his own bond with the archfiend Thasaidon. When Ouphaloc died, he took the name of Namirrha, and went forth as a mighty sorcerer among the wandering peoples and the deep-buried mummies of Tasuun. But never could he forget the miseries of his boyhood in Ummaos and the wrong he had endured from Zotulla; and year by year he spun over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And his fame grew ever darker and vaster, and men feared him in remote lands beyond Tasuun. With bated whispers they spoke of his deeds in the cities of Yoros, and in Zul-Bha-Shair, the abode of the ghoulish deity Mordiggian. And long before the coming of Namirrha himself, the people of Ummaos knew him as a fabled scourge that was direr than simoom or pestilence.\nNow, in the years that followed the going-forth of the boy Narthos from Ummaos, Pithaim, the father of Prince Zotulla, was slain by the sting of a small adder that had crept into his bed for warmth on an autumn night. Some said that the adder had been purveyed by Zotulla, but this was a thing that no man could verily affirm. After the death of Pithaim, Zotulla, being his only son, was emperor of Xylac, and ruled evilly from his throne in Ummaos. Indolent he was, and tyrannic, and full of strange luxuries and cruelties; but the people, who were also evil, acclaimed him in his turpitude. So he prospered, and the lords of Hell and Heaven smote him not. And the red suns and ashen moons went westward over Xylac, falling into that seldom-voyaged sea, which, if the mariners\u2019 tales were true, poured evermore like a swiftening river past the infamous isle of Naat, and fell in a worldwide cataract upon nether space from the far, sheer edge of Earth.\nGrosser still he grew, and his sins were as overswollen fruits that ripen above a deep abyss. But the winds of time blew softly; and the fruits fell not. And Zotulla laughed amid his fools and his eunuchs and his lemans; and the tale of his luxuries was borne afar, and was told by dim outland peoples, as a twin marvel with the bruited necromancies of Namirrha.\nIt came to pass, in the year of the Hyena, and the month of the star Canicule, that a great feast was given by Zotulla to the inhabitants of Ummaos. Meats that had been cooked in exotic spices from Sotar, isle of the east, were spread everywhere; and the ardent wines of Yoros and Xylac, filled as with subterranean fires, were poured inexhaustibly from huge urns for all. The wines awoke a furious mirth and a royal madness; and afterward they brought a slumber no less profound than the Lethe of the tomb. And one by one, as they drank, the revellers fell down in the streets, the houses and gardens, as if a plague had struck them; and Zotulla slept in his banquet-hall of gold and ebony, with his odalisques and chamberlains about him. So, in all Ummaos, there was no man or woman wakeful at the hour when Sirius began to fall toward the west.\nThus it was that none saw or heard the coming of Namirrha. But awakening heavily in the latter forenoon, the emperor Zotulla heard a confused babble, a troublous clamor of voices from such of his eunuchs and women as had awakened before him. Inquiring the cause, he was told that a strange prodigy had occurred during the night; but, being still bemused with wine and slumber, he comprehended little enough of its nature, till his favorite concubine, Obexah, led him to the eastern portico of the palace, from which he could behold the marvel with his own eyes.\nNow the palace stood alone at the center of Ummaos, and to the north, west and south, for wide intervals of distance, there stretched the imperial gardens, full of superbly arching palms and loftily spiring fountains. But to eastward was a broad open area, used as a sort of common, between the palace and the mansions of high optimates. And in this space, which had lain wholly vacant at eve, a building towered colossal and lordly beneath the full-risen sun, with domes like monstrous fungi of stone that had come up in the night. And the domes, rearing level with those of Zotulla, were builded of death-white marble; and the huge fa\u00e7ade, with multi-columned porticoes and deep balconies, was wrought in alternate zones of night-black onyx and porphyry hued as with dragons\u2019 blood. And Zotulla swore lewdly, calling with hoarse blasphemies on the gods and devils of Xylac; and great was his dumfoundment, deeming the marvel a work of wizardry. The women gathered about him, crying out with shrill cries of awe and terror; and more and more of his courtiers, awakening, came to swell the hub-bub; and the fat castradoes diddered in their cloth-of-gold like immense black jellies in golden basins. But Zotulla, mindful of his dominion as emperor of all Xylac, strove to conceal his own trepidation, saying:\n\u201cNow who is this that has presumed to enter Ummaos like a jackal in the dark, and has made his impious den in proximity and counterview of my palace? Go forth, and inquire the miscreant\u2019s name; but ere you go, instruct the headsman to make sharp his double-handed sword.\u201d\nThen, fearing the emperor\u2019s wrath if they tarried, certain of the chamberlains went forth unwillingly and approached the portals of the strange edifice. It seemed that the portals were deserted till they drew near, and then, on the threshold, there appeared a titanic skeleton, taller than any man of earth; and it strode forward to meet them with ell-long strides. The skeleton was swathed in a loin-cloth of scarlet silk with a buckle of jet, and it wore a black turban, starred with diamonds, whose topmost foldings nearly touched the high lintel. Eyes like flickering marsh-fires burned in its deep eye-sockets; and a blackened tongue like that of a long-dead man protruded between its teeth; but otherwise it was clean of flesh, and the bones glittered whitely in the sun as it came onward.\nThe chamberlains were mute before it, and there was no sound except the golden creaking of their girdles, the shrill rustling of their silks, as they shook and trembled. And the foot-bones of the skeleton clicked sharply on the pavement of black onyx as it paused; and the putrefying tongue began to quiver between its teeth; and it uttered these words in an unctuous, nauseous voice:\n\u201cReturn, and tell the emperor Zotulla that Namirrha, seer and magician, has come to dwell beside him.\u201d\nHearing the skeleton speak as if it had been a living man, and hearing the dread name of Namirrha as men hear the tocsin of doom in some fallen city, the chamberlains could stand before it no longer, and they fled with ungainly swiftness and bore the message to Zotulla.\nNow, learning who it was that had come to neighbor with him in Ummaos, the emperor\u2019s wrath died out like a feeble and blustering flame on which the wind of darkness had blown; and the vinous purple of his cheeks was mottled with a strange pallor; and he said nothing, but his lips mumbled loosely as if in prayer or malediction. And the news of Namirrha\u2019s coming passed like the flight of evil night-birds through all the palace and throughout the city, leaving a noisome terror that abode in Ummaos thereafter till the end. For Namirrha, through the black renown of his thaumaturgies and the frightful entities who served him, had become a power that no secular sovereign dared dispute; and men feared him everywhere, even as they feared the gigantic, shadowy lords of Hell and of outer space. And in Ummaos, people said that he had come on the desert wind from Tasuun with his underlings, even as the pestilence comes, and had reared his house in an hour with the aid of devils beside Zotulla\u2019s palace. And they said that the foundations of the house were laid on the adamantine cope of Hell; and in its floors were pits at whose bottom burned the nether fires, or stars could be seen as they passed under in lowermost night. And the followers of Namirrha were the dead of strange kingdoms, the demons of sky and earth and the abyss, and mad, impious, hybrid things that the sorcerer himself created from forbidden unions.\nMen shunned the neighborhood of his lordly house; and in the palace of Zotulla few cared to approach the windows and balconies that gave thereon; and the emperor himself spoke not of Namirrha, pretending to ignore the intruder; and the women of the harem babbled evermore with an evil gossip concerning Namirrha and his concubines. But the sorcerer himself was not beheld by the people of that city, though some believed that he walked forth at will, clad with invisibility. His servitors were likewise not seen; but a howling as of the damned was sometimes heard to issue from his portals; and sometimes there came a strange cachinnation, as if some adamantine image had laughed aloud; and sometimes there was a chuckling like the sound of shattered ice in a frozen hell. Dim shadows moved in the porticoes when there was neither sunlight nor lamp to cast them; and red, eery lights appeared and vanished in the windows at eve, like a blinking of demoniac eyes. And slowly the ember-colored suns went over Xylac, and were quenched in far seas; and the ashy moons were blackened as they fell nightly toward the hidden gulf. Then, seeing that the wizard had wrought no open evil, and that none had endured palpable harm from his presence, the people took heart; and Zotulla drank deeply, and feasted in oblivious luxury as before; and dark Thasaidon, prince of all turpitudes, was the true but never-acknowledged lord of Xylac. And in time the men of Ummaos bragged a little of Namirrha and his dread thaumaturgies, even as they had boasted of the purple sins of Zotulla.\nBut Namirrha, still unbeheld by living men and living women, sat in the inner walls of that house which his devils had reared for him, and spun over and over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And the wrong done by Zotulla to Narthos in old times was the least of those cruelties which the emperor had forgotten.\nNow, when the fears of Zotulla were somewhat lulled, and his women gossiped less often of the neighboring wizard, there occurred a new wonder and a fresh terror. For, sitting one eve at his banquet-table with his courtiers about him, the emperor heard a noise as of myriad iron-shod hooves that came trampling through the palace gardens. And the courtiers also heard the sound, and were startled amid their mounting drunkenness; and the emperor was angered, and he sent certain of his guards to examine into the cause of the trampling. But peering forth upon the moon-bright lawns and parterres, the guards beheld no visible shape, though the loud sounds of trampling still went to and fro. It seemed as if a rout of wild stallions passed and re-passed before the fa\u00e7ade of the palace with tumultuous gallopings and capricoles. And a fear came upon the guards as they looked and listened; and they dared not venture forth, but returned to Zotulla. And the emperor himself grew sober when he heard their tale; and he went forth with high blusterings to view the prodigy. And all night the unseen hooves rang out sonorously on the pavement of onyx, and ran with deep thuddings over the grasses and flowers. The palm-fronds waved on the windless air as if parted by racing steeds; and visibly the tall-stemmed lilies and broad-petaled exotic blossoms were trodden under. And rage and terror nested together in Zotulla\u2019s heart as he stood in a balcony above the garden, hearing the spectral tumult, and beholding the harm done to his rarest flower-beds. The women, the courtiers and eunuchs cowered behind him, and there was no slumber for any occupant of the palace; but toward dawn the clamor of hooves departed, going toward Namirrha\u2019s house.\nWhen the dawn was full-grown above Ummaos, the emperor walked forth with his guards about him, and saw that the crushed grasses and broken-down stems were blackened as if by fire where the hooves had fallen. Plainly were the marks imprinted, like the tracks of a great company of horses, in all the lawns and parterres; but they ceased at the verge of the gardens. And though everyone believed that the visitation had come from Namirrha, there was no proof of this in the grounds that fronted the sorcerer\u2019s abode; for here the turf was untrodden.\n\u201cA pox upon Namirrha, if he has done this!\u201d cried Zotulla. \u201cFor what harm have I ever done him? Verily, I shall set my heel on the dog\u2019s neck; and the torture-wheel shall serve him even as these horses from Hell have served my blood-red lilies of Sotar and my vein-colored irises of Naat and my orchids from Uccastrog which were purple as the bruises of love. Yea, though he stand the viceroy of Thasaidon above Earth, and overlord of ten thousand devils, my wheel shall break him, and fires shall heat the wheel white-hot in its turning, till he withers black as the seared blossoms.\u201d Thus did Zotulla make his brag; but he issued no orders for the execution of his threat; and no man stirred from the palace towards Namirrha\u2019s house. And from the portals of the wizard none came forth; or if any came there was no visible sign or sound.\nSo the day went over, and the night rose, bringing later a moon that was slightly darkened at the rim. And the night was silent; and Zotulla, sitting long at the banquet-table, drained his wine-cup often and wrathfully, muttering new threats against Namirrha. And the night wore on, and it seemed that the visitation would not be repeated. But at midnight, lying in his chamber with Obexah, and fathom-deep in his slumber from the wine, Zotulla was awakened by a monstrous clangor of hooves that raced and capered in the palace porticoes and in the long balconies. All night the hooves thundered back and forth, echoing awfully in the vaulted stone, while Zotulla and Obexah, listening, huddled close amid their cushions and coverlets; and all the occupants of the palace, wakeful and fearful, heard the noise but stirred not from their chambers. A little before dawn the hooves departed suddenly; and afterward, by day, their marks were found found on the marble flags of the porches and balconies; and the marks were countless, deep-graven, and black as if branded there by flame.\nLike mottled marble were the emperor\u2019s cheeks when he saw the hoof-printed floors; and terror stayed with him henceforth, following him to the depths of his inebriety, since he knew not where the haunting would cease. His women murmured and some wished to flee from Ummaos, and it seemed that the revels of the day and evening were shadowed by ill wings that left their umbrage in the yellow wine and bedimmed the aureate lamps. And again, toward midnight, the slumber of Zotulla was broken by the hooves, which came galloping and pacing on the palace-roof and through all the corridors and the halls. Thereafter, till dawn, the hooves filled the palace with their iron clatterings, and they rung hollowly on the topmost domes, as if the coursers of gods had trodden there, passing from heaven to heaven in tumultuous cavalcade.\nZotulla and Obexah, lying together while the terrible hooves went to and fro in the hall outside their chamber, had no heart or thought for sin, nor could they find any comfort in their nearness. In the gray hour before dawn they heard a great thundering high on the barred brazen door of the room, as if some mighty stallion, rearing, had drummed there with his forefeet. And soon after this, the hooves went away, leaving a silence like an interlude in some gathering storm of doom. Later, the marks of the hooves were found everywhere in the halls, marring the bright mosaics. Black holes were burnt in the golden-threaded rugs and the rugs of silver and scarlet; and the high white domes were pitted pox-wise with the marks; and far up on the brazen door of Zotulla\u2019s chamber the prints of a horse\u2019s forefeet were incised deeply.\nNow, in Ummaos, and throughout Xylac, the tale of this haunting became known, and the thing was deemed an ominous prodigy, though people differed in their interpretations. Some held that the sending came from Namirrha, and was meant as a token of his supremacy above all kings and emperors; and some thought that it came from a new wizard who had risen in Tinarath, far to the east, and who wished to supplant Namirrha. And the priests of the gods of Xylac held that their various deities had dispatched the haunting, as a sign that more sacrifices were required in the temples.\nThen, in his hall of audience, whose floor of sard and jasper had been grievously pocked by the unseen hooves, Zotulla called together many priests and magicians and soothsayers, and asked them to declare the cause of the sending and devise a mode of exorcism. But, seeing that there was no agreement among them, Zotulla provided the several priestly sects with the wherewithal of sacrifice to their sundry gods, and sent them away; and the wizards and prophets, under threat of decapitation if they refused, were enjoined to visit Namirrha in his mansion of sorcery and learn his will, if haply the sending were his and not the work of another.\nLoth were the wizards and the soothsayers, fearing Namirrha, and caring not to intrude upon the frightful mysteries of his obscure mansion. But the swordsmen of the emperor drove them forth, lifting great crescent blades against them when they tarried; so one by one, in a straggling order, the delegation went towards Namirrha\u2019s portals and vanished into the devil-builded house.\nPale, muttering and distraught, like men who have looked upon hell and have seen their doom, they returned before sunset to the emperor. And they said that Namirrha had received them courteously and had sent them back with this message:\n\u201cBe it known to Zotulla that the haunting is a sign of that which he has long forgotten; and the reason of the haunting will be revealed to him at the hour prepared and set apart by destiny. And the hour draws near: for Namirrha bids the emperor and all his court to a great feast on the afternoon of the morrow.\u201d\nHaving delivered this message, to the wonder and consternation of Zotulla, the delegation begged his leave to depart. And though the emperor questioned them minutely, they seemed unwilling to relate the circumstances of the visit to Namirrha; nor would they describe the sorcerer\u2019s fabled house, except in a vague manner, each contradicting the other as to what he had seen. So, after a little, Zotulla bade them go, and when they had gone he sat musing for a long while on the invitation of Namirrha, which was a thing he cared not to accept but feared to decline. That evening he drank even more liberally than was his wont; and he slept a Lethean slumber, nor was there any noise of trampling hooves about the palace to awaken him. And silently, during the night, the prophets and magicians passed like furtive shadows from Ummaos; and no man saw them depart; and at morning they were gone from Xylac into other lands, never to return....\nNow, on that same evening, in the great hall of his house, Namirrha sat alone, having dismissed the familiars who attended him ordinarily. Before him, on an altar of jet, was the dark, gigantic statue of Thasaidon which a devil-begotten sculptor had wrought in ancient days for an evil king of Tasuun, called Pharnoc. The archdemon was depicted in the guise of a full-armored warrior, lifting a spiky mace as if in heroic battle. Long had the statue lain in the desert-sunken palace of Pharnoc, whose very site was disputed by the nomads; and Namirrha, by his divination, had found it and had reared up the infernal image to abide with him always thereafter. And often, through the mouth of the statue, Thasaidon would utter oracles to Namirrha, or would answer interrogations.\nBefore the black-armored image there hung seven silver lamps, wrought in the form of horses\u2019 skulls, with flames issuing changeably in blue and purple and crimson from their eye-sockets. Wild and lurid was their light, and the face of the demon, peering from under his crested helmet, was filled with malign, equivocal shadows that shifted and changed eternally. And sitting in his serpent-carven chair, Namirrha regarded the statue grimly, with a deep-furrowed frown between his eyes: for he had asked a certain thing of Thasaidon, and the fiend, replying through the statue, had refused him. And rebellion was in the heart of Namirrha, grown mad with pride, and deeming himself the lord of all sorcerers and a ruler by his own right among the princes of devildom. So, after long pondering, he repeated his request in a bold and haughty voice, like one who addresses an equal rather than the all-formidable suzerain to whom he had sworn a fatal fealty.\n\u201cI have helped you heretofore in all things,\u201d said the image, with stony and sonorous accents that were echoed metallically in the seven silver lamps. \u201cYea, the undying worms of fire and darkness have come forth like an army at your summons, and the wings of nether genii have risen to occlude the sun when you called them. But, verily, I will not aid you in this vengeance you have planned: for the emperor Zotulla has done me no wrong and has served me well though unwittingly; and the people of Xylac, by reason of their turpitudes, are not the least of my terrestial worshippers. Therefore, Namirrha, it were well for you to live in peace with Zotulla, and well to forget this olden wrong that was done to the beggar-boy Narthos. For the ways of destiny are strange, and the workings of its laws sometimes hidden; and truly, if the hooves of Zotulla\u2019s palfrey had not spurned you and trodden you under, your life had been otherwise, and the name and renown of Namirrha had still slept in oblivion as a dream undreamed. Yea, you would tarry still as a beggar in Ummaos, content with a beggar\u2019s guerdon, and would never have fared forth to become the pupil of the wise and learned Ouphaloc; and I, Thasaidon, would have lost the lordliest of all necromancers who have accepted my service and my bond. Think well, Namirrha, and ponder these matters: for both of us, it would seem, are indebted to Zotulla in all gratitude for the trampling he gave you.\u201d\n\u201cYea, there is a debt,\u201d Namirrha growled implacably. \u201cAnd truly I will pay the debt tomorrow, even as I have planned.... There are Those who will aid me, Those who will answer my summoning in your despite.\u201d\n\u201cIt is an ill thing to affront me,\u201d said the image, after an interval. \u201cAnd also, it is not wise to call upon Those that you designate. However, I perceive clearly that such is your intent. You are proud and stubborn and revengeful. Do then, as you will, but blame me not for the outcome.\u201d\nSo, after this, there was silence in the hall where Namirrha sat before the eidolon; and the flames burned darkly, with changeable colors, in the skull-shapen lamps; and the shadows fled and returned, unresting, on the face of the statue and the face of Namirrha. Then, toward midnight, the necromancer arose and went upward by many spiral stairs to a high dome of his house in which there was a single small round window that looked forth on the constellations. The window was set in the top of the dome; but Namirrha had contrived, by means of his magic, that one entering by the last spiral of the stairs would suddenly seem to descend rather than climb, and, reaching the last step, would peer downward through the window while stars passed under him in a giddying gulf. There, kneeling, Namirrha touched a secret spring in the marble, and the circular pane slid back without sound. Then, lying prone on the interior of the dome, with his face over the abyss, and his long beard trailing stiffly into space, he whispered a pre-human rune, and held speech with certain entities who belonged neither to Hell nor the mundane elements, and were more fearsome to invoke than the infernal genii or the devils of earth, air, water, and flame. With them he made his contract, defying Thasaidon\u2019s will, while the air curdled about him with their voices, and rime gathered palely on his sable beard from the cold that was wrought by their breathing as they leaned earthward.\nLaggard and loth was the awakening of Zotulla from his wine; and quickly, ere he opened his eyes, the daylight was poisoned for him by the thought of that invitation which he feared to accept or decline. But he spoke to Obexah, saying:\n\u201cWho, after all, is this wizardly dog, that I should obey his summons like a beggar called in from the street by some haughty lord?\u201d\nObexah, a golden-skinned and oblique-eyed girl from Uccastrog, Isle of the Torturers, eyed the emperor subtly, and said:\n\u201cO Zotulla, it is yours to accept or refuse, as you deem fitting. And truly, it is a small matter for the lord of Ummaos and all Xylac, whether to go or to stay, since naught can impugn his sovereignty. Therefore, were it not as well to go?\u201d For Obexah, though fearful of the wizard, was curious regarding that devil-builded house of which so little was known; and likewise, in the manner of women, she wished to behold the famed Namirrha, whose mien and appearance were still but a far-brought legend in Ummaos.\n\u201cThere is something in what you say,\u201d admitted Zotulla. \u201cBut an emperor, in his conduct, must always consider the public good; and there are matters of state involved, which a woman can scarcely be expected to understand.\u201d\nSo, later in the forenoon, after an ample and well-irrigated breakfast, he called his chamberlains and courtiers about him and took counsel with them. And some advised him to ignore the invitation of Namirrha; and others held that the invitation be accepted, lest a graver evil than the trampling of ghostly hooves be sent upon the palace and the city.\nThen Zotulla called the many priesthoods before him in a body, and sought to resummon the wizards and soothsayers who had fled privily in the night. Among all the latter, there was none who answered the crying of his name through Ummaos; and this aroused a certain wonder. But the priests came in a greater number than before, and thronged the hall of audience so that the paunches of the foremost were straightened against the imperial dais and the buttocks of the hindmost were flattened on the rear walls and pillars. And Zotulla debated with them the matter of acceptance or refusal. And the priests argued, as before, that Namirrha was nowherewise concerned with the sending ; and his invitation, they said, portended no harm nor bale to the emperor; and it was plain, from the terms of the message, that an oracle would be imparted to Zotulla by the wizard; and this oracle, if Namirrha were a true archimage, would confirm their own holy wisdom and re\u00ebstablish the divine source of the sending; and the gods of Xylac would again be glorified.\nThen, having heard the pronouncement of the priests, the emperor instructed his treasurers to load them down with new offerings; and calling unctuously upon Zotulla and all his household the vicarious blessings of the several gods, the priests departed. And the day wore on, and the sun passed its meridian, falling slowly beyond Ummaos through the spaces of the afternoon that were floored with sea-ending deserts. And still Zotulla was irresolute; and he called his wine-bearers, bidding them pour for him the strongest and most magistral of their vintages; but in the wine he found neither certitude nor decision.\nSitting still on his throne in the hall of audience, he heard, toward middle afternoon, a mighty and clamorous outcry that arose at the palace portals. There were deep wailings of men and the shrillings of eunuchs and women, as if terror passed from tongue to tongue, invading the halls and apartments. And the fearful clamor spread throughout all the palace, and Zotulla, rousing from the lethargy of wine, was about to send his attendants to inquire the cause.\nThen, into the hall, there filed an array of tall mummies, clad in royal cerements of purple and scarlet, and wearing gold crowns on their withered craniums. And after them, like servitors, came gigantic skeletons who wore loin-cloths of nacarat orange and about whose upper skulls, from brow to crown, live serpents of banded saffron and ebon had wrapped themselves for head-dresses. And the mummies bowed before Zotulla, saying with thin, sere voices:\n\u201cWe, who were kings of the wide realm of Tasuun aforetime, have been sent as a guard of honor for the emperor Zotulla, to attend him as is befitting when he goes forth to the feast prepared by Namirrha.\u201d\nThen with dry clickings of their teeth, and whistlings as of air through screens of fretted ivory, the skeletons spoke:\n\u201cWe, who were giant warriors of a race forgotten, have also been sent by Namirrha, so that the emperor\u2019s household, following him to the feast, should be guarded from all peril and should fare forth in such pageantry as is meet and proper.\u201d\nWitnessing these prodigies, the wine-bearers and other attendants cowered about the imperial dais or hid behind the pillars, while Zotulla, with pupils swimming starkly in a bloodshot white, with face bloated and ghastly pale, sat frozen on his throne and could utter no word in reply to the ministers of Namirrha.\nThen, coming forward, the mummies said in dusty accents: \u201cAll is made ready, and the feast awaits the arrival of Zotulla.\u201d And the cerements of the mummies stirred and fell open at the bosom, and small rodent monsters, brown as bitumen, eyed as with accursed rubies, reared forth from the eaten hearts of the mummies like rats from their holes and chittered shrilly in human speech, repeating the words. The skeletons in turn took up the solemn sentence; and the black and saffron serpents hissed it from their skulls; and the words were repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain furry creatures of dubious form, hitherto unseen by Zotulla, who sat behind the ribs of the skeletons as if in cages of white wicker.\nLike a dreamer who obeys the doom of dreams, the emperor rose from his throne and went forward, and the mummies surrounded him like an escort. And each of the skeletons drew from the reddish-yellow folds of his loin-cloth a curiously pierced archaic flute of silver; and all began a sweet and evil and deathly fluting as the emperor went out through the halls of the palace. A fatal spell was in the music: for the chamberlains, the women, the guards, the eunuchs, and all members of Zotulla\u2019s household even to the cooks and scullions, were drawn like a procession of night-walkers from the rooms and alcoves in which they had vainly hidden themselves; and marshaled by the flutists, they followed after Zotulla. A strange thing it was to behold this mighty company of people, going forth in the slanted sunlight toward Namirrha\u2019s house, with a cort\u00e8ge of dead kings about them, and the blown breath of skeletons thrilling eldritchly in the silver flutes. And little was Zotulla comforted when he found the girl Obexah at his side, moving, as he, in a thralldom of involitent horror, with the rest of his women close behind.\nComing to the open portals of Namirrha\u2019s house, the emperor saw that they were guarded by great crimson-wattled things, half dragon, half man, who bowed before him, sweeping their wattles like bloody besoms on the flags of dark onyx. And the emperor passed with Obexah between the louting monsters, with the mummies, the skeletons and his own people behind him in strange pageant, and entered a vast and multicolumned hall, where the daylight, following timidly, was drowned by the baleful arrogant blaze of a thousand lamps.\nEven amid his horror, Zotulla marvelled at the vastness of the chamber, which he could hardly reconcile with the mansion\u2019s outer length and height and breadth, though these indeed were of most palatial amplitude. For it seemed that he gazed down great avenues of topless pillars, and vistas of tables laden with piled-up viands and thronged urns of wine, that stretched away before him into luminous distance and gloom as of starless night.\nIn the wide intervals between the tables, the familiars of Namirrha and his other servants went to and fro incessantly, as if a fantasmagoria of ill dreams were embodied before the emperor. Kingly cadavers in robes of time-rotted brocade, with worms seething in their eye-pits, poured a blood-like wine into cups of the opalescent horn of unicorns. Lamias, trident-tailed, and four-breasted chimeras, came in with fuming platters lifted high by their brazen claws. Dog-headed devils, tongued with lolling flames, ran forward to offer themselves as ushers for the company. And before Zotulla and Obexah, there appeared a curious being with the full-fleshed lower limbs and hips of a great black woman and the clean-picked bones of some titanic ape from thereupward.\nVerily, it seemed to Zotulla that they had gone a long way into some malignly litten cavern of Hell, when they came to that perspective of tables and columns down which the monster had led them. Here, at the room\u2019s end, apart from the rest, was a table at which Namirrha sat alone, with the flames of the seven horse-skull lamps burning restlessly behind him, and the mailed black image of Thasaidon towering from the altar of jet at his right hand. And a little aside from the altar, a diamond mirror was upborne by the claws of iron basilisks.\nNamirrha rose to greet them, observing a solemn and funereal courtesy. His eyes were bleak and cold as distant stars in the hollows wrought by strange fearful vigils. His lips were like a pale-red seal on a shut parchment of doom. His beard flowed stiffly in black-anointed banded locks across the bosom of his vermilion robe, like a mass of straight black serpents. Zotulla felt the blood pause and thicken about his heart, as if congealing into ice. And Obexah, peering beneath lowered lids, was abashed and frightened by the visible horror that invested this man and hung upon him even as royalty upon a king. But amid her fear, she found room to wonder what manner of man he was in his intercourse with women.\n\u201cI bid you welcome, O Zotulla, to such hospitality as is mine to offer,\u201d said Namirrha, with the iron ringing of some hidden funereal bell deep down in his hollow voice. \u201cPrithee, be seated at my table.\u201d\nZotulla saw that a chair of ebony had been placed for him opposite Namirrha; and another chair, less stately and imperial, had been placed at the left hand for Obexah. And the twain seated themselves; and Zotulla saw that his people were sitting likewise at other tables throughout the huge hall, with the frightful servants of Namirrha waiting upon them busily, like devils attending the damned.\nThen Zotulla perceived that a dark and corpse-like hand was pouring wine for him in a crystal cup; and upon the hand was the signet-ring of the emperors of Xylac, set with a monstrous fire-opal in the mouth of a golden bat: even such a ring as Zotulla wore perpetually on his index-finger. And, turning, he beheld at his right hand a figure that bore the likeness of his father, Pithaim, after the poison of the adder, spreading through his limbs, had left behind it the purple bloating of death. And Zotulla, who had caused the adder to be placed in the bed of Pithaim, cowered in his seat and trembled with a guilty fear. And the thing that wore the similtude of Pithaim, whether corpse or an image wrought by Namirrha\u2019s enchantment, came and went at Zotulla\u2019s elbow, waiting upon him with stark, black, swollen fingers that never fumbled. Horribly he was aware of its bulging, unregarding eyes, and its livid purple mouth that was locked in a rigor of mortal silence, and the spotted adder that peered at intervals with chill orbs from its heavy-folded sleeve as it leaned beside him to replenish his cup or to serve him with meat. And dimly, through the icy mist of his terror, the emperor beheld the shadowy-armored shape, like a moving replica of the still, grim statue of Thasaidon, which Namirrha had reared up in his blasphemy to perform the same office for himself. And vaguely, without comprehension, he saw the dreadful ministrant that hovered beside Obexah: a flayed and eyeless corpse in the image of her first lover, a boy from Cyntrom who had been cast ashore in shipwreck on the Isle of the Torturers. There Obexah had found him, lying behind the ebbing wave, and reviving the boy, she had hidden him awhile in a secret cave for her own pleasure, and had brought him food and drink. Later, wearying, she had betrayed him to the Torturers, and had taken a new delight in the various pangs and ordeals inflicted upon him before death by that cruel, pernicious people.\n\u201cDrink,\u201d said Namirrha, quaffing a strange wine that was red and dark as if with disastrous sunsets of lost years. And Zotulla and Obexah drank the wine, feeling no warmth in their veins thereafter, but a chill as of hemlock mounting slowly toward the heart.\n\u201cVerily, \u2019tis a good wine,\u201d said Namirrha, \u201cand a proper one in which to toast the furthering of our acquaintance: for it was buried long ago with the royal dead, in amphorae of somber jasper shapen like funeral urns; and my ghouls found it, whenas they came to dig in Tasuun.\u201d\nNow it seemed that the tongue of Zotulla froze in his mouth, as a mandrake freezes in the rime-bound soil of winter; and he found no reply to Namirrha\u2019s courtesy.\n\u201cPrithee, make trial of this meat,\u201d quoth Namirrha, \u201cfor it is very choice, being the flesh of that boar which the Torturers of Uccastrog are wont to pasture on the well-minced leavings of their wheels and racks; and, moreover, my cooks have spiced it with the powerful balsams of the tomb, and have farced it with the hearts of adders and the tongues of black cobras.\u201d\nNaught could the emperor say; and even Obexah was silent, being sorely troubled in her turpitude by the presence of that flayed and piteous thing which had the likeness of her lover from Cyntrom. And the dread of the necromancer grew prodigiously; for his knowledge of this old, forgotten crime, and the raising of the fantasm, appeared to her a more baleful magic than all else.\n\u201cNow, I fear,\u201d said Namirrha, \u201cthat you find the meat devoid of savor, and the wine without fire. So, to enliven our feasting, I shall call forth my singers and my musicians.\u201d\nHe spoke a word unknown to Zotulla or Obexah, which sounded throughout the mighty hall as if a thousand voices in turn had taken it up and prolonged it. Anon there appeared the singers, who were she-ghouls with shaven bodies and hairy shanks, and long yellow tushes full of shredded carrion curving across their chaps from mouths that fawned hyena-wise on the company. Behind them entered the musicians, some of whom were male devils pacing erect on the hind-quarters of sable stallions and plucking with the fingers of white apes at lyres of the bone and sinew of cannibals from Naat; and others were pied satyrs puffing their goatish cheeks at hautboys formed from the bosom-skin of Negro queens and the horn of rhinoceri.\nThey bowed before Namirrha with grotesque ceremony. Then, without delay, the she-ghouls began a most dolorous and execrable howling, as of jackals that have sniffed their carrion; and the satyrs and devils played a lament that was like the moaning of desert-born winds through forsaken palace harems. And Zotulla shivered, for the singing filled his marrow with ice, and the music left in his heart a desolation as of empires fallen and trod under by the iron-shod hooves of time. Ever, amid that evil music, he seemed to hear the sifting of sand across withered gardens, and the windy rustling of rotted silks upon couches of bygone luxury, and the hissing of coiled serpents from the low fusts of shattered columns. And the glory that had been Ummaos seemed to pass away like the blown pillars of the simoom.\n\u201cNow that was a brave tune,\u201d said Namirrha when the music ceased and the she-ghouls no longer howled. \u201cBut verily I fear that you find my entertainment somewhat dull. Therefore, my dancers shall dance for you.\u201d\nHe turned toward the great hall, and described in the air an enigmatic sign with the fingers of his right hand. In answer to the sign, a hueless mist came down from the high roof and hid the room like a fallen curtain for a brief interim. There was a babel of sounds, confused and muffled, beyond the curtain, and a crying of voices faint as if with distance.\nThen, dreadfully, the vapor rolled away, and Zotulla saw that the leaden tables had gone. In the wide interspaces of the columns, his palace-inmates, the chamberlains, the eunuchs, the courtiers and odalisques and all the others, lay trussed with thongs on the floor, like so many fowls of glorious plumage. Above them, in time to a music made by the lyrists and flutists of the necromancer, a troupe of skeletons pirouetted with light clickings of their toe-bones; and a rout of mummies bowed stiffly; and others of Namirrha\u2019s creatures moved with mysterious caperings. To and fro they leapt on the bodies of the emperor\u2019s people, in the paces of an evil saraband. At every step they grew taller and heavier, till the saltant mummies were as the mummies of Anakim, and the skeletons were boned as colossi; and louder the music rose, drowning the faint cries of Zotulla\u2019s people. And huger still became the dancers, towering far into vaulted shadow among the vast columns, with thudding feet that wrought thunder in the room; and those whereon they danced were as grapes trampled for a vintage in autumn; and the floor ran deep with a sanguine must.\nAs a man drowning in a noisome, night-bound fen, the emperor heard the voice of Namirrha:\n\u201cIt would seem that my dancers please you not. So now I shall present you a most royal spectacle. Arise and follow me, for the spectacle is one that requires an empire for its stage.\u201d\nZotulla and Obexah rose from their chairs in the fashion of night-walkers. Giving no backward glance at their ministering phantoms, or the hall where the dancers bounded, they followed Namirrha to an alcove beyond the altar of Thasaidon. Thence, by the upward-coiling stairways, they came at length to a broad high balcony that faced Zotulla\u2019s palace and looked forth above the city roofs toward the bourn of sunset.\nIt seemed that several hours had gone by in that hellish feasting and entertainment; for the day was near to its close, and the sun, which had fallen from sight behind the imperial palace, was barring the vast heavens with bloody rays.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d said Namirrha, adding a strange vocable to which the stone of the edifice resounded like a beaten gong.\nThe balcony pitched a little, and Zotulla, looking over the balustrade, beheld the roofs of Ummaos lessen and sink beneath him. It seemed that the balcony flew skyward to a prodigious height, and he peered down across the domes of his own palace, upon the houses, the tilled fields and the desert beyond, and the huge sun brought low on the desert\u2019s verge. And Zotulla grew giddy; and the chill airs of the upper heavens blew upon him. But Namirrha spoke another word, and the balcony ceased to ascend.\n\u201cLook well,\u201d said the necromancer, \u201con the empire that was yours, but shall be yours no longer.\u201d Then, with arms outstretched toward the sunset, he called aloud the twelve names that were perdition to utter, and after them the tremendous invocation: Gna padambis devompra thungis furidor avoragomon.\nInstantly, it seemed that great ebon clouds of thunder beetled against the sun. Lining the horizon, the clouds took the form of colossal monsters with heads and members somewhat resembling those of stallions. Rearing terribly, they trod down the sun like an extinguished ember; and racing as if in some hippodrome of Titans, they rose higher and vaster, coming towards Ummaos. Deep, calamitous rumblings preceded them, and the earth shook visibly, till Zotulla saw that these were not immaterial clouds, but actual living forms that had come forth to tread the world in macrocosmic vastness. Throwing their shadows for many leagues before them, the coursers charged as if devil-ridden into Xylac, and their feet descended like falling mountain crags upon far oases and towns of the outer wastes.\nLike a many-turreted storm they came, and it seemed that the world shrank gulfward, tilting beneath the weight. Still as a man enchanted into marble, Zotulla stood and beheld the ruining that was wrought on his empire. And closer drew the gigantic stallions, racing with inconceivable speed, and louder was the thundering of their footfalls, that now began to blot the green fields and fruited orchards lying for many miles to the west of Ummaos. And the shadow of the stallions climbed like an evil gloom of eclipse, till it covered Ummaos; and looking up, the emperor saw their eyes halfway between earth and zenith, like baleful suns that glare down from soaring cumuli.\nThen, in the thickening gloom, above that insupportable thunder, he heard the voice of Namirrha, crying in mad triumph:\n\u201cKnow, Zotulla, that I have called up the coursers of Thamogorgos, lord of the abyss. And the coursers will tread your empire down, even as your palfrey trod and trampled in former time a beggar-boy named Narthos. And learn also that I, Namirrha, was that boy.\u201d And the eyes of Namirrha, filled with a vainglory of madness and bale, burned like malign, disastrous stars at the hour of their culmination.\nTo Zotulla, wholly mazed with the horror and tumult, the necromancer\u2019s words were no more than shrill, shrieked overtones of the tempest of doom; and he understood them not. Tremendously, with a rending of staunch-built roofs, and an instant cleavage and crumbling down of mighty masonries, the hooves descended upon Ummaos. Fair temple-domes were pashed like shells of the haliotis, and haughty mansions were broken and stamped into the ground even as gourds; and house by house the city was trampled flat with a crashing as of worlds beaten into chaos. Far below, in the darkened streets, men and camels fled like scurrying emmets but could not escape. And implacably the hooves rose and fell, till ruin was upon half the city, and night was over all. The palace of Zotulla was trodden under, and now the forelegs of the coursers loomed level with Namirrha\u2019s balcony, and their heads towered awfully above. It seemed that they would rear and trample down the necromancer\u2019s house; but at that moment they parted to left and right, and a dolorous glimmering came from the low sunset; and the coursers went on, treading under them that portion of Ummaos which lay to the eastward. And Zotulla and Obexah and Namirrha looked down on the city\u2019s fragments as on a shard-strewn midden, and heard the cataclysmic clamor of the hooves departing toward eastern Xylac.\n\u201cNow that was a goodly spectacle,\u201d quoth Namirrha. Then, turning to the emperor, he added malignly: \u201cThink not that I have done with thee, however, or that doom is yet consummate.\u201d\nIt seemed that the balcony had fallen to its former elevation, which was still a lofty vantage above the sharded ruins. And Namirrha plucked the emperor by the arm and led him from the balcony to an inner chamber, while Obexah followed mutely. The emperor\u2019s heart was crushed within him by the trampling of such calamities, and despair weighed upon him like a foul incubus on the shoulders of a man lost in some land of accursed night. And he knew not that he had been parted from Obexah on the threshold of the chamber, and that certain of Namirrha\u2019s creatures, appearing like shadows, had compelled the girl to go downward with them by the stairs, and had stifled her outcries with their rotten cerements as they went.\nThe chamber was one that Namirrha used for his most unhallowed rites and alchemies. The rays of the lamps that illumed it were saffron-red like the spilt ichor of devils, and they flowed on aludels and crucibles and black athanors and alembics whereof the purpose was hardly to be named by mortal man. The sorcerer heated in one of the alembics a dark liquid full of star-cold lights, while Zotulla looked on unheeding. And when the liquid bubbled and sent forth a spiral vapor, Namirrha distilled it into goblets of gold-rimmed iron, and gave one of the goblets to Zotulla and retained the other himself. And he said to Zotulla with a stern imperative voice: \u201cI bid thee quaff this liquor.\u201d\nZotulla, fearing that the draft was poison, hesitated. And the necromancer regarded him with a lethal gaze, and cried loudly: \u201cFearest thou to do as I?\u201d and therewith he set the goblet to his lips.\nSo the emperor drank the draft, constrained as if by the bidding of some angel of death, and a darkness fell upon his senses. But, ere the darkness grew complete, he saw that Namirrha had drained his own goblet.\nThen, with unspeakable agonies, it seemed that the emperor died; and his soul float free; and again he saw the chamber, though with bodiless eyes. And discarnate he stood in the saffron-crimson light, with his body lying as if dead on the floor beside him, and near it the prone body of Namirrha and the two fallen goblets.\nStanding thus, he beheld a strange thing: for anon his own body stirred and arose, while that of the necromancer remained still as death. And Zotulla looked at his own lineaments and his figure in its short cloak of azure samite sewn with black pearls and balas-rubies; and the body lived before him, though with eyes that held a darker fire and a deeper evil than was their wont. Then, without corporeal ears, Zotulla heard the figure speak, and the voice was the strong, arrogant voice of Namirrha, saying:\n\u201cFollow me, O houseless phantom, and do in all things as I enjoin thee.\u201d\nLike an unseen shadow, Zotulla followed the wizard, and the twain went downward by the stairs to the great banquet hall. They came to the altar of Thasaidon and the mailed image, with the seven horse-skull lamps burning before it as formerly. Upon the altar, Zotulla\u2019s beloved leman Obexah, who alone of all women had power to stir his sated heart, was lying bound with thongs at Thasaidon\u2019s feet. But the hall beyond was deserted, and nothing remained of that Saturnalia of doom except the fruit of the treading, which had flowed together in dark pools among the columns.\nNamirrha, using the emperor\u2019s body in all ways for his own, paused before the dark eidolon; and he said to the spirit of Zotulla: \u201cBe imprisoned in this image, without power to free thyself or to stir in any wise.\u201d\nBeing wholly obedient to the will of the necromancer, the soul of Zotulla was embodied in the statue, and he felt its cold, gigantic armor about him like a straight sarcophagus, and he peered forth immovably from the bleak eyes that were overhung by its carven helmet.\nGazing thus, he beheld the change that had come on his own body through the sorcerous possession of Namirrha: for below the short azure cloak, the legs had turned suddenly to the hind legs of a black stallion, with hooves that glowed redly as if heated by infernal fires. And even as Zotulla watched this prodigy, the hooves glowed white and incandescent, and fumes mounted from the floor beneath them.\nThen, on the black altar, the hybrid abomination came pacing haughtily toward Obexah, and smoking footprints appeared behind it as it came. Pausing beside the girl, who lay supine and helpless regarding it with eyes that were pools of frozen horror, it raised one glowing hoof and set the hoof on her naked bosom between the small breast-cups of golden filigree begemmed with rubies. And the girl screamed beneath that atrocious treading as the soul of one newly damned might scream in hell; and the hoof glared with intolerable brilliance, as if freshly plucked from a furnace wherein the weapons of demons were forged.\nAt that moment, in the cowed and crushed and sodden shade of the emperor Zotulla, close-locked within the adamantine image, there awoke the manhood that had slumbered unaroused before the ruining of his empire and the trampling of his retinue. Immediately a great abhorrence and a high wrath were alive in his soul, and mightily he longed for his own right arm to serve him, and a sword in his right hand.\nThen it seemed that a voice spoke within him, chill and bleak and awful, and as if uttered inwardly by the statue itself. And the voice said: \u201cI am Thasaidon, lord of the seven hells beneath the earth, and the hells of man\u2019s heart above the earth, which are seven times seven. For the moment, O Zotulla, my power is become thine for the sake of a mutual vengeance. Be one in all ways with the statue that has my likeness, even as the soul is one with the flesh. Behold! there is a mace of adamant in thy right hand. Lift up the mace, and smite.\u201d\nZotulla was aware of a great power within him, and giant thews about him that thrilled with the power and responded agilely to his will. He felt in his mailed right hand the haft of the huge spiky-headed mace; and though the mace was beyond the lifting of any man in mortal flesh, it seemed no more than a goodly weight to Zotulla. Then, rearing he mace like a warrior in battle, he struck down with one crashing blow the impious thing that wore his own rightful flesh united with the legs and hooves of a demon courser. And the thing crumpled swiftly down and lay with the brain spreading pulpily from its shattered skull on the shining jet. And the legs twitched a little and then grew still; and the hooves glowed from a fiery, blinding white to the redness of red-hot iron, cooling slowly.\nFor a space there was no sound, other than the shrill screaming of the girl Obexah, mad with pain and the terror of those prodigies which she had beheld. Then in the soul of Zotulla, grown sick with that screaming, the chill, awful voice of Thasaidon spoke again:\n\u201cGo free, for there is nothing more for thee to do.\u201d So the spirit of Zotulla passed from the image of Thasaidon and found in the wide air the freedom of nothingness and oblivion.\nBut the end was not yet for Namirrha, whose mad, arrogant soul had been loosened from Zotulla\u2019s body by the blow, and had returned darkly, not in the manner planned by the magician, to its own body lying in the room of accursed rites and forbidden transmigrations. There Namirrha woke anon, with a dire confusion in his mind, and a partial forgetfulness: for the curse of Thasaidon was upon him now because of his blasphemies.\nNothing was clear in his thought except a malign, exorbitant longing for revenge; but the reason thereof, and the object, were as doubtful shadows. And still prompted by that obscure animus, he arose; and girding to his side an enchanted sword with runic sapphires and opals in the hilt, he descended the stairs and came again to the altar of Thasaidon, where the mailed statue stood as impassive as before, with the poised mace in its immovable right hand, and below it, on the altar, the double sacrifice.\nA veil of weird darkness was upon the senses of Namirrha, and he saw not the stallion-legged horror that lay dead with slowly blackening hooves; and he heard not the moaning of the girl Obexah, who still lived beside it. But his eyes were drawn by the diamond mirror that was upheld in the claws of black iron basilisks beyond the altar; and going to the mirror, he saw therein a face that he knew no longer for his own. And because his eyes were shadowed and his brain filled with the shifting webs of delusion, he took the face for that of the emperor Zotulla. Insatiable as Hell\u2019s own flame, his old hatred rose within him; and he drew the enchanted sword and began to hew therewith at the reflection. Sometimes, because of the curse laid upon him, and the impious transmigration which he had performed, he thought himself Zotulla warring with the necromancer; and again, in the shiftings of his madness, he was Namirrha smiting at the emperor; and then, without name, he fought a nameless foe. And soon the sorcerous blade, though tempered with formidable spells, was broken close to the hilt, and Namirrha beheld the image still unharmed. Then, howling aloud the half-forgotten runes of a most tremendous curse, made invalid through his own forgettings, he hammered still with the heavy sword-hilt on the mirror, till the runic sapphires and opals cracked in the hilt and fell away at his feet in little fragments.\nObexah, dying on the altar, saw Namirrha battling with his image, and the spectacle moved her to mad laughter like the pealing of bells of ruined crystal. And above her laughter, and above the cursings of Namirrha, there came anon like the rumbling of a swift-driven storm the thunder made by the macrocosmic stallions of Thamogorgos, returning gulfward through Xylac over Ummaos, to trample down the one house that they had spared aforetime.\n"

She raised her glass and drank from\nit. \"Mel always has love on his mind.\" she said, \"Don't you, honey?\" She smiled, and I thought\nthat was the last of it.\n\"I just wouldn't call Ed's behavior love. That's all I'm saying, honey,\" Mel said. \u201cWhat about you\nguys?\" Mel said to Laura and me. \"Does that sound like love to you?\"\n\u201cI\u2019m the wrong person to ask,\" I said. \"I didn't even know the man. I've only heard his name\nmentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what\nyou're saying is that love is an absolute.\"\nMel said, 'The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try\nto kill people.\"\nLaura said, \"I don't know anything about Ed, or anything about the situation. But who can judge\nanyone else's situation?\"\nI touched the back of Laura's hand. She gave me a quick smile. I picked up Laura's hand. It was\nwarm, the nails polished, perfectly manicured. I encircled the broad wrist with my fingers, and I\nheld her.\n\"When I left, he drank rat poison.\" Terri said. She clasped her arms with her hands. \u201cThey took\nhim to the hospital in Same Fe. That's where we lived then, about ten miles out. They saved his\nlife. But his gums went crazy from it. I mean they pulled away from his teeth. After that, his\nteeth stood out like fangs. My God,\u201d Terri said. She waited a minute, then let go of her arms and\npicked up her glass.\n\u201cWhat people won't do!\" Laura said.\n\"He\u2019s out of the action now,\u201d Mel said. 'He's dead.\"\nMel handed me the saucer of limes. I took a section, squeezed it over my drink, and stirred the\nice cubes with my finger.\n\"It gets worse,\" Terri said. \"He shot himself in the mouth. But he bungled that too. Poor Ed,\u201d she\nsaid. Terri shook her head.\n\"Poor Ed nothing,\" Mel said. \"He was dangerous.\"\nMel was forty-five years old. He was tall and curly soft hair. His face and arms were brown\nfrom the tennis he played. When he was sober, his gestures, all his movements, were precise,\nvery careful.\n\u201cHe did love me though, Mel. Grant me that,\" Terri said. \"That's all I'm asking. He didn\u2019t love\nme the way you love me. I'm not saying that. But he loved me. You can grant me that, can't\nyou?\"\n3\n\"What do you mean, he bungled it?\" I said.\nLaura leaned forward with her glass. She put her elbows on the table and held her glass in both\nhands. She glanced from Mel to Terri and waited with a look of bewilderment on her open face,\nas if amazed that such things happened to people you were friendly with.\n\"How'd he bungle it when he killed himself?\" I said.\n\u201cI'll tell you what happened,\" Mel said. \"He took this twenty-two pistol he'd bought to threaten\nTerri and me with. Oh, I'm serious. The man was always threatening. You should have seen the\nway we lived in those days. Like fugitives. I even bought a gun myself. Can you believe it? A\nguy like me? But I did, I bought one for self-defense and carried it in the glove compartment.\nSometimes I'd have to leave the apartment in the middle of the night. To go to the hospital, you\nknow? Terri and l weren't married then, and my first wife had the house and kids, the dog, every-\nthing, and Terri and I were living in this apartment here. Sometimes, as I say, I'd get a call in the\nmiddle of the night and have to go in to the hospital at two or three in the morning. It'd be dark\nout there in the parking lot, and I'd break into a sweat be fore I could even get to my car. I never\nknew if he was going to come up out of the shrubbery or from behind a car and start shooting. I\nmean, the man was crazy. He was capable of wiring a bomb, anything. He used to call my\nservice at all hours and say he needed to talk to the doctor, and when I'd return the call, he'd say,\n'Son of a bitch, your days are numbered.' Little things like that. It was scary, I'm telling you.\"\n\"I still feel sorry for him,\" Terri said.\"It sounds like a nightmare\" Laura said. \"But what exactly\nhappened after he shot himself?\"\nLaura is a legal secretary. We'd met in a professional capacity. Before we knew it, it was a\ncourtship. She's thirty-five, three years younger than I am. In addition to being in love, we like\neach other and enjoy one another's company. She's easy to be with.\n\"What happened?\" Laura said.\nMel said, \"He shot himself in the mouth in his room. Someone heard the shot and told the\nmanager. They came in with a passkey, saw what had happened, and called an ambulance. I\nhappened to be there when they brought him in, alive but past recall. The man lived for three\ndays. His head swelled up to twice the size of a normal head. I\u2019d never seen anything like it, and\nI hope I never do again. Terri wanted to go in and sit with him when she found out about it. We\nhad a fight over it. I didn't think she should see him like that. I didn't think she should see him,\nand I still don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWho won the fight?\" Laura said.\nI was in the room with him when he died\". Terri said \"He never came up out of it. But I sat with\nhim. He didn't have anyone else.\"\n\"He was dangerous,\" Mel said. \"If you call that love, you can have it.\"\n4\nIt was love,\" Terri said. \u201cSure, it's abnormal in most people's eyes. But he was `willing to die for\nit. He did die for it.\"\n\u201cI sure as hell wouldn't call it love,\" Mel said. \"I mean, no one knows what he did it for. I've\nseen a lot of suicides, and l couldn't say anyone ever knew what they did it for.\"\nMel put his hands behind his neck and tilted his chair back. \"I'm not interested in that kind of\nlove,\" he said. \u201cIf that's love, you can have it.\"\nTerri said, \"We were afraid Mel even made a will out and wrote to his brother in California who\nused to be a Green Beret. Mel told him who to look for if something happened to him.\"\nTerri drank from her glass. She said, \"But Mel's right--we lived like fugitives. We were afraid.\nMel was, weren't you, honey? I even called the police at one point, but they were no help. They\nsaid they couldn't do anything until Ed actually did something. Isn't that a laugh?\" Terry said.\nShe poured the last of the gin into her glass and waggled the bottle. Mel got up from the table\nand went to the cupboard. He took down another bottle.\n\"Well, Nick and I know what hove is,\" Laura said. \"For us, I mean,\" Laura said. She bumped my\nknee with her knee. \"You're supposed to say something now,\" Laura said, and turned her smile\non me.\nFor an answer, I took Laura's hand and raised it to my lips. I made a big production out of\nkissing her hand. Everyone was amused.\n\"We're lucky,\" I said.\n\"You guys,\" Terri said. \"Stop that now. You're making me sick. You're still on the honeymoon,\nfor God's sake. You're still gaga, for crying out loud. Just wait. How long have you been\ntogether now? How long has it been? A year? Longer than a year?\"\n\"Going on a year and a half,\" Laura said, flushed and smiling. Oh, now,\" Terri said. \"Wait a\nwhile.\"\nShe held her drink and gazed at Laura.\n\"I'm only kidding,\" Terri said.\nMel opened the gin and went around the table with the bottle.\n\"Here, you guys,\" he said. \"Let's have a toast. I want to propose a toast. A toast to love. To true\nlove,\" Mel said.\nWe touched glasses\n5\n\"To love.\" we said.\nOutside in the backyard, one of the dogs began to bark. The leaves of the aspen that leaned past\nthe window ticked against the glass. The afternoon sun was like a presence in this room, the\nspacious light of ease and generosity. We could have been anywhere, somewhere enchanted. We\nraised our glasses again and grinned at each other like children who had agreed on something\nforbidden.\n\"I'll tell you what real love is,\" Mel said. \"I mean, I'll give you a good example. And then you\ncan draw your own conclusions.\" He poured more gin into his glass. He added an ice cube and\na sliver of lime. We waited and sipped our drinks. Laura and I touched knees again. I put a hand\non her warm thigh and left it there.\n\"What do any of us really know about love?'' Mel said. \"It seems to me we're just beginners at\nlove. We say we love each other and we do, I don't doubt it. I love Terri and Terri loves me, and\nyou guys love each other too. You know the kind of love I\u2019m talking about now. Physical love,\nthat impulse that drives you to someone special, as well as love of the other person's being, his or\nher essence, as it were. Carnal love and, well, call it sentimental love, the day-to-day caring\nabout the other person. But sometimes I have a hard time accounting for the fact that I must have\nloved my first wife too. But I did. I know I did. So I suppose I am like Terri in that regard. Terri\nand Ed.\" He thought about it and then he went on. \"There was a time when I thought I loved my\nfirst wife more than life itself. But now I hate her guts. I do. How do you explain that? What\nhappened to that love? What happened to it, is what I'd like to know. I wish someone could tell\nme. Then there's Ed. Okay, we're back to Ed. He loves Terri so much he tries to kill her and he\nwinds up killing himself.\" Mel stopped talking and swallowed from his glass. \"You guys have\nbeen together eighteen months and you love each other. It shows all over you. You glow with it.\nBut you both loved other people before you met each other. You've both been married before,\njust like us. And you probably loved other people before that too, even. Terri and I have been\ntogether five years, been married for four. And the terrible thing, the terrible thing is, but the\ngood thing too, the saving grace, you might say, is that if something happened to one of us--\nexcuse me for saying this-but if something happened to one of us tomorrow I think the other one,\nthe other person, would grieve for a while, you know, but then the surviving party would go out\nand love again, have someone else soon enough. All this, all of this love we're talking about, it\nwould just be a memory. Maybe not even a memory. Am I wrong? Am I way off base? Because\nI want you to set me straight if you think I'm wrong. I want to know. I mean, I don't know\nanything, and I'm the first one to admit it.\"\n\"Mel, for God's sake,\u201d Terri said. She reached out and took hold of his wrist. \"Are you getting\ndrunk? Honey? Are you drunk?\"\n\"Honey, I'm just talking.\" Mel said. \"All right? I don't have to be drunk to say what I think. I\nmean, we're all just talking, right?\" Mel said. He fixed his eyes on her.\n\"Sweetie, I'm not criticizing,\" Terri said.\n6\nShe picked up her glass.\n\"I'm not on call today,\" Mel said. \"Let me remind you of that. I am not on call,\u201d he said.\n\"Mel, we love you,\" Laura said.\nMel looked at Laura. He looked at her as if he could not place her, as if she was not the woman\nshe was.\n\"Love you too, Laura,\" Mel said. \"And you, Nick, love you too. You know something?\" Mel\nsaid, \"You guys are our pals,\" Mel said. He picked up his glass.\nMel said, \"I was going to tell you about something. I mean, I was going to prove a point. You\nsee, this happened a few months ago, but it's still going on right now, and it ought to make us\nfeel ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk above love.\"\n\"Come on now,\" Terri said. \"Don't talk like you're drunk if you're not drunk.\u201d\n\"Just shut up for once in your life,\" Mel said very quietly, \"Well you do me a favor and do that\nfor a minute? So as I was saying, there's this old couple who had this car wreck out on the\ninterstate. A kid hit them and they were all torn to shit and nobody was giving them much chance\nto pull through,\"\nTerri looked at us and then back at Mel. She seemed anxious, or maybe that's too strong a word.\nMel was handing the bottle around the table.\n\"I was on call that night,\" Mel said. \"It was May or maybe it was June. Terri and I had just sat\ndown to dinner when the hospital called. There'd been this thing out on the interstate. Drunk kid,\nteenager, plowed his dad\u2019s pickup into this camper with this old couple in it. They were in their\nmid-seventies, that couple. The kid\u2014eighteen, nineteen, something\u2014he was DOA. Taken the\nsteering wheel through his sternum. The old couple, they were alive, you understand. I mean, just\nbarely. But they had everything. Multiple fractures, internal injuries, hemorrhaging, contusions,\nlacerations, the works, and they each of them had themselves concussions. They were in a bad\nway, believe me. And, of course, their age was two strikes against them. I'd say she was worse\noff than he was. Ruptured spleen along with everything else. Both kneecaps broken. But they'd\nbeen wearing their seatbelts and, God knows, that's what saved them for the time being.\"\n\"Folks, this is an advertisement for the National Safety Council,\" Terri said. \"This is your\nspokesman, Dr. Melvin R. McGinnis, talking.\" Terri laughed. \u201cMel,\u201d she said, \"sometimes\nyou're just too much. But I love you, hon,\" she said.\n\u201cHoney, I love you,\u201d Mel said.\nHe leaned across the table. Terri met him halfway. They kissed.\n7\n\u201cTerri\u2019s right, Mel said as he settle himself again. \u201cGet those seatbelts on. But seriously, they\nwere in some shape, those oldsters. By the time I got down there, the kid was dead, as I said. He\nwas off in a corner, laid out on a gurney. I took one look at the old couple and told the ER nurse\nto get me a neurologist and an orthopedic man and a couple of surgeons down there right away.\u201d\nHe drank from his glass. \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep this short,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we took the two of them up to\nthe OR and worked like fuck on them most of the night. They had these incredible reserves,\nthose two. You see that once in a while. So we did everything that could be done, and toward\nmorning we\u2019re giving them a fifty-fifty chance, maybe less than that for her. So here they are,\nstill alive the next morning. So, okay, we move them into the ICU, which is where they both\nkept plugging away at it for two weeks, hitting it better and better on all the scopes. So we\ntransfer them out to their own room.\u201d\nMel stopped talking. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s drink this cheapo gin the hell up. Then we\u2019re going\nto dinner, right? Terri and I know a new place. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll go, to this new place we\nknow about. But we\u2019re not going until we finish up this cut-rate, lousy gin.\u201d\nTerri said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually eaten there yet. But it looks good. From the outside, you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cI like food,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIf I had it to do all over again, I\u2019d be a chef, you know? Right, Terri?\u201d\nMel said.\nHe laughed. He fingered the ice in his glass.\n\u201cTerri knows,\u201d he said. \u201cTerri can tell you. But let me say this. If I could come back again in a\ndifferent life, a different time and all, you know what? I\u2019d like to come back as a knight. You\nwere pretty safe wearing all that armor. It was all right being a knight until gunpowder and\nmuskets and pistols came along.\u201d\n\u201cMel would like to ride a horse and carry a lance,\u201d Terri said.\n\u201cOr just a woman,\u201d Mel said.\n\u201cShame on you,\u201d Laura said.\n\u201cThe serfs never had it good,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut I guess even the knight were vessels to someone.\nIsn\u2019t that the way it worked? But then everyone is always a vessel to someone. Isn\u2019t that right?\nTerri? But what I like about knights, besides their ladies, was that they had that suit of armor,\nyou know, and they couldn\u2019t get hurt very easy. No cars in those days, you know? No drunk\nteenagers to tear into your ass.\u201d\n\u201cVassals,\u201d Terri said.\n8\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Mel said.\n\u201cVassals,\u201d Terri said. \u201cThey were called vassals, not vessels.\u201d\n\u201cVassals, vessels,\u201d Mel said, \u201cwhat the fuck\u2019s the difference? You knew what I meant anyway.\nAll right,\u201d Mel said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not educated. I learned my stuff, I\u2019m a heart surgeon, sure, but I\u2019m\njust a mechanic. I go in and fuck around and fix things. Shit,\u201d Mel said.\n\u201cModesty doesn\u2019t become you,\u201d Terri said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a humble sawbones,\u201d I said. \u201cBut sometimes they suffocated in all that armor, Mel.\nThey\u2019d even have heart attacks if it got too hot and they were too tired and worn out. I read\nsomewhere that they\u2019d fall off their horses and not be able to get up because they were too tired\nto stand with all that armor on them. They got trampled by their own horses sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Mel said. \u201cSome vassal would come along and spear the bastard in the name\nof love. Or whatever the fuck it was they fought over in those days.\u201d\n\u201cSame things we fight over these days,\u201d Terri said.\nLaura said, \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d\nThe color was still high in Laura\u2019s cheeks. Her eyes were bright. She brought her glass to her\nlips.\nMel poured himself another drink. He looked at the label closely as if studying a long row of\nnumbers. Then he slowly put the bottle down on the table and slowly reached for the tonic\nwater.\n\u201cWhat about the old couple?\u201d Laura asked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t finish that story you started.\u201d\nLaura was having a hard time lighting her cigarette. Her matches kept going out.\nThe sunshine inside the room was different now, changing, getting thinner. But the leaves\noutside the window were still shimmering, and I stared at the pattern they made on the panes and\non the Formica counter. They weren\u2019t the same patterns, of course.\n\u201cWhat about the old couple?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOlder but wiser,\u201d Terri said.\nMel stared at her.\nTerri said, \u201cGo on with your story, hon. I was only kidding. Then what happened?\u201d\n\u201cTerri, sometimes,\u201d Mel said.\n9\n\u201cPlease, Mel,\u201d Terri said. \u201cDon\u2019t always be so serious, sweetie. Can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d\nHe held his glass and gazed steadily at his wife.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Laura said.\nMel fastened his eyes on Laura. He said, \u201cLaura, if I didn\u2019t have Terri and if I didn\u2019t love her so\nmuch, and if Nick wasn\u2019t my best friend, I\u2019d fall in love with you. I\u2019d carry you off, honey,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\u201cTell your story,\u201d Terri said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go to that new place, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWhere was I?\u201d he said. He stared at the table and then he began again.\n\u201cI dropped in to see each of them every day, sometimes twice a day if I was up doing other calls\nanyway. Casts and bandages, head to foot, the both of them. You know, you\u2019ve seen it in the\nmovies. That\u2019s just the way they looked, just like in the movies. Little eye-holes and nose-holes\nand mouth-holes. And she had to have her legs slung up on top of it. Well, the husband was\nvery depressed for the longest while. Even after he found out that his wife was going to pull\nthrough, he was still very depressed. Not about the accident, though. I mean, the accident was\none thing, but it wasn\u2019t everything. I\u2019d get up to his mouth-hole, you know, and he\u2019d say no, it\nwasn\u2019t the accident exactly but it was because he couldn\u2019t see her through his eye-holes. He said\nthat was what was making him feel so bad. Can you imagine? I\u2019m telling you, the man\u2019s heart\nwas breaking because he couldn\u2019t turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.\u201d\nMel looked around the table and shook his head at what he was going to say. \"I mean, it was\nkilling the old fart just because he couldn't look at the fucking woman.\"\nWe all look at Mel.\n\"Do you see what I'm saying?\" he said.\nMaybe we were a little drunk by then. I know it was hard keeping things in focus. The light was\ndraining out of the room, going back through the window where it had come from. Yet nobody\nmade a move to get up from the table to turn on the overhead light.\n\"Listen,\" Mel said. \"Let's finish this fucking gin. There's about enough left here for one shooter\nall around. Then let's go eat. Let's go to the new place.\"\n\"He's depressed,\" Terri said. \"Mel, why don't you take a pill?\"\nMel shook his head, \"I've taken everything there is.\"\n\"We all need a pill now and then.\" I said.\n\u201cSome people are born needing them,\" Terri said.\n10\nShe was using her finger to rub at something on the table. Then she stopped rubbing,\n\"I think I want to call my kids,\" Mel said. \"Is that all right with everybody? I'll call my kids,\" he\nsaid.\nTerri said, \"What if Marjorie answers the phone? You guys, you've heard us on the subject of\nMarjorie? Honey, you know you don't want to talk to Marjorie. It'll make you feel even worse.\"\n\"I don't want to talk to Marjorie,\" Mel said, \"But I want to talk to my kids.\"\n\"There isn't a day goes by that Mel doesn't say he wishes she'd get married again. Or else die,\"\n'Terri said. \"For one thing,\" Terri said, she's bankrupting us. Mel says it\u2019s just to spite him that\nshe won't get married again. She has a boyfriend who lives with her and the kids, so Mel is\nsupporting the boyfriend too.\"\n\"She's allergic to bees,\" Mel said. \"If I'm not praying she'll get married again, I'm praying she'll\nget herself stung to death by a swarm of fucking bees.\"\n\"Shame on you,\" Laura said.\n\"Bzzzzzzz,\" Mel said, turning his fingers into bees and buzzing them at Terri's throat. Then he let\nhis hands drop all the way to his sides.\n\"She's vicious,\" Mel said \"Sometimes I think I'll go up there dressed like a beekeeper. You\nknow, that hat that\u2019s like a helmet with the plate that comes down over your face, the big gloves,\nand the padded coat? I'll knock on the door and let loose a hive of bees in the house. But first I\u2019d\nmake sure the kids were out, of course.\"\nHe crossed one leg over the other. It seemed to take him a lot of time to do it. Then he put both\nfeet on the floor and leaned forward, elbows on the table, his chin cupped in his hands.\nMaybe I won't call the kids, after all. Maybe it isn't such a hot idea. Maybe well just go eat. How\ndoes that sound?\"\n\"Sounds fine to me,\" I said \"Eat or not eat. Or keep drinking. I could head right on out into the\nsunset.\"\n\u201cWhat does that mean, honey?\u201d Laura said.\n\"It just means what I said,\" I said. \"It means I could just keep going. That's all it means.\"\nA could eat something myself,\" Laura said. \"I don't think I've ever been so hungry in my life. Is\nthere something to nibble on?\"\n\"I'll put out some cheese and crackers,\u201d Terri said.\n11\nBut Terri just sat there. She did not get up to get anything.\nMel turned his glass over. He spilled it out on the table.\n\u201cGin\u2019s gone,\" Mel said.\nTerri said, \u201cNow what?\"\nI could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat\nthere making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark.\n"

                "content": "\nThere was a woman who was beautiful, who started with all the advantages, yet she had no luck. She married for love, and the love turned to dust. She had bonny children, yet she felt they had been thrust upon her, and she could not love them. They looked at her coldly, as if they were finding fault with her. And hurriedly she felt she must cover up some fault in herself. Yet what it was that she must cover up she never knew. Nevertheless, when her children were present, she always felt the centre of her heart go hard. This troubled her, and in her manner she was all the more gentle and anxious for her children, as if she loved them very much. Only she herself knew that at the centre of her heart was a hard little place that could not feel love, no, not for anybody. Everybody else said of her: \"She is such a good mother. She adores her children.\" Only she herself, and her children themselves, knew it was not so. They read it in each other's eyes.\nThere were a boy and two little girls. They lived in a pleasant house, with a garden, and they had discreet servants, and felt themselves superior to anyone in the neighbourhood.\nAlthough they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the house. There was never enough money. The mother had a small income, and the father had a small income, but not nearly enough for the social position which they had to keep up. The father went in to town to some office. But though he had good prospects, these prospects never materialised. There was always the grinding sense of the shortage of money, though the style was always kept up.\nAt last the mother said, \"I will see if I can't make something.\" But she did not know where to begin. She racked her brains, and tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything successful. The failure made deep lines come into her face. Her children were growing up, they would have to go to school. There must be more money, there must be more money. The father, who was always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he never would be able to do anything worth doing. And the mother, who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and her tastes were just as expensive.\nAnd so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase: There must be more money! There must be more money! The children could hear it all the time, though nobody said it aloud. They heard it at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the nursery. Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart doll's-house, a voice would start whispering: \"There must be more money! There must be more money!\" And the children would stop playing, to listen for a moment. They would look into each other's eyes, to see if they had all heard. And each one saw in the eyes of the other two that they too had heard. \"There must be more money! There must be more money!\"\nIt came whispering from the springs of the still-swaying rocking-horse, and even the horse, bending his wooden, champing head, heard it. The big doll, sitting so pink and smirking in her new pram, could hear it quite plainly, and seemed to be smirking all the more self-consciously because of it. The foolish puppy, too, that took the place of the teddy-bear, he was looking so extraordinarily foolish for no other reason but that he heard the secret whisper all over the house: \"There must be more money.\"\nYet nobody ever said it aloud. The whisper was everywhere, and therefore no one spoke it. Just as no one ever says: \"We are breathing!\" in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going all the time.\n\"Mother!\" said the boy Paul one day. \"Why don't we keep a car of our own? Why do we always use uncle's, or else a taxi?\"\n\"Because we're the poor members of the family,\" said the mother.\n\"But why are we, mother?\"\n\"Well--I suppose,\" she said slowly and bitterly, \"it's because your father has no luck.\"\nThe boy was silent for some time.\n\"Is luck money, mother?\" he asked, rather timidly.\n\"No, Paul! Not quite. It's what causes you to have money.\"\n\"Oh!\" said Paul vaguely. \"I thought when Uncle Oscar said filthy lucker, it meant money.\"\n\"Filthy lucre does mean money,\" said the mother. \"But it's lucre, not luck.\"\n\"Oh!\" said the boy. \"Then what is luck, mother?\"\n\"It's what causes you to have money. If you're lucky you have money. That's why it's better to be born lucky than rich. If you're rich, you may lose your money. But if you're lucky, you will always get more money.\"\n\"Oh! Will you! And is father not lucky?\"\n\"Very unlucky, I should say,\" she said bitterly.\nThe boy watched her with unsure eyes.\n\"Why?\" he asked.\n\"I don't know. Nobody ever knows why one person is lucky and another unlucky.\"\n\"Don't they? Nobody at all? Does nobody know?\"\n\"Perhaps God! But He never tells.\"\n\"He ought to, then. And aren't you lucky either, mother?\"\n\"I can't be, if I married an unlucky husband.\"\n\"But by yourself, aren't you?\"\n\"I used to think I was, before I married. Now I think I am very unlucky indeed.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Well--never mind! Perhaps I'm not really,\" she said.\nThe child looked at her, to see if she meant it. But he saw, by the lines of her mouth, that she was only trying to hide something from him.\n\"Well, anyhow,\" he said stoutly, \"I'm a lucky person.\"\n\"Why?\" said his mother, with a sudden laugh.\nHe stared at her. He didn't even know why he had said it.\n\"God told me,\" he asserted, brazening it out.\n\"I hope He did, dear!\" she said, again with a laugh, but rather bitter.\n\"He did, mother!\"\n\"Excellent!\" said the mother, using one of her husband's exclamations.\nThe boy saw she did not believe him; or rather, that she paid no attention to his assertion. This angered him somewhere, and made him want to compel her attention.\nHe went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the clue to \"luck\". Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck. He wanted luck, he wanted it, he wanted it. When the two girls were playing dolls, in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse, charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls peer at him uneasily. Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them. The little girls dared not speak to him.\nWhen he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into its lowered face. Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was wide and glassy bright.\n\"Now!\" he would silently command the snorting steed. \"Now take me to where there is luck! Now take me!\"\nAnd he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he had asked Uncle Oscar for. He knew the horse could take him to where there was luck, if only he forced it. So he would mount again, and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there. He knew he could get there.\n\"You'll break your horse, Paul!\" said the nurse.\n\"He's always riding like that! I wish he'd leave off!\" said his elder sister Joan.\nBut he only glared down on them in silence. Nurse gave him up. She could make nothing of him. Anyhow he was growing beyond her.\nOne day his mother and his Uncle Oscar came in when he was on one of his furious rides. He did not speak to them.\n\"Hallo! you young jockey! Riding a winner?\" said his uncle.\n\"Aren't you growing too big for a rocking-horse? You're not a very little boy any longer, you know,\" said his mother.\nBut Paul only gave a blue glare from his big, rather close-set eyes. He would speak to nobody when he was in full tilt. His mother watched him with an anxious expression on her face.\nAt last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical gallop, and slid down.\n\"Well, I got there!\" he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still flaring, and his sturdy long legs straddling apart.\n\"Where did you get to?\" asked his mother.\n\"Where I wanted to go to,\" he flared back at her.\n\"That's right, son!\" said Uncle Oscar. \"Don't you stop till you get there. What's the horse's name?\"\n\"He doesn't have a name,\" said the boy.\n\"Gets on without all right?\" asked the uncle.\n\"Well, he has different names. He was called Sansovino last week.\"\n\"Sansovino, eh? Won the Ascot. How did you know his name?\"\n\"He always talks about horse-races with Bassett,\" said Joan.\nThe uncle was delighted to find that his small nephew was posted with all the racing news. Bassett, the young gardener who had been wounded in the left foot in the war, and had got his present job through Oscar Cresswell, whose batman he had been, was a perfect blade of the \"turf\". He lived in the racing events, and the small boy lived with him.\nOscar Cresswell got it all from Bassett.\n\"Master Paul comes and asks me, so I can't do more than tell him, sir,\" said Bassett, his face terribly serious, as if he were speaking of religious matters.\n\"And does he ever put anything on a horse he fancies?\"\n\"Well--I don't want to give him away--he's a young sport, a fine sport, sir. Would you mind asking him himself? He sort of takes a pleasure in it, and perhaps he'd feel I was giving him away, sir, if you don't mind.\"\nBassett was serious as a church.\nThe uncle went back to his nephew, and took him off for a ride in the car.\n\"Say, Paul, old man, do you ever put anything on a horse?\" the uncle asked.\nThe boy watched the handsome man closely.\n\"Why, do you think I oughtn't to?\" he parried.\n\"Not a bit of it! I thought perhaps you might give me a tip for the Lincoln.\"\nThe car sped on into the country, going down to Uncle Oscar's place in Hampshire.\n\"Honour bright?\" said the nephew.\n\"Honour bright, son!\" said the uncle.\n\"Well, then, Daffodil.\"\n\"Daffodil! I doubt it, sonny. What about Mirza?\"\n\"I only know the winner,\" said the boy. \"That's Daffodil!\"\n\"Daffodil, eh?\" There was a pause. Daffodil was an obscure horse comparatively.\n\"Uncle!\"\n\"Yes, son?\"\n\"You won't let it go any further, will you? I promised Bassett.\"\n\"Bassett be damned, old man! What's he got to do with it?\"\n\"We're partners! We've been partners from the first! Uncle, he lent me my first five shillings, which I lost. I promised him, honour bright, it was only between me and him: only you gave me that ten-shilling note I started winning with, so I thought you were lucky. You won't let it go any further, will you?\"\nThe boy gazed at his uncle from those big, hot, blue eyes, set rather close together. The uncle stirred and laughed uneasily.\n\"Right you are, son! I'll keep your tip private. Daffodil, eh! How much are you putting on him?\"\n\"All except twenty pounds,\" said the boy. \"I keep that in reserve.\"\nThe uncle thought it a good joke.\n\"You keep twenty pounds in reserve, do you, you young romancer? What are you betting, then?\"\n\"I'm betting three hundred,\" said the boy gravely. \"But it's between you and me, Uncle Oscar! Honour bright?\"\nThe uncle burst into a roar of laughter.\n\"It's between you and me all right, you young Nat Gould,\" he said, laughing. \"But where's your three hundred?\"\n\"Bassett keeps it for me. We're partners.\"\n\"You are, are you! And what is Bassett putting on Daffodil?\"\n\"He won't go quite as high as I do, I expect. Perhaps he'll go a hundred and fifty.\"\n\"What, pennies?\" laughed the uncle.\n\"Pounds,\" said the child, with a surprised look at his uncle. \"Bassett keeps a bigger reserve than I do.\"\nBetween wonder and amusement, Uncle Oscar was silent. He pursued the matter no further, but he determined to take his nephew with him to the Lincoln races.\n\"Now, son,\" he said, \"I'm putting twenty on Mirza, and I'll put five for you on any horse you fancy. What's your pick?\"\n\"Daffodil, uncle!\"\n\"No, not the fiver on Daffodil!\"\n\"I should if it was my own fiver,\" said the child.\n\"Good! Good! Right you are! A fiver for me and a fiver for you on Daffodil.\"\nThe child had never been to a race-meeting before, and his eyes were blue fire. He pursed his mouth tight, and watched. A Frenchman just in front had put his money on Lancelot. Wild with excitement, he flayed his arms up and down, yelling 'Lancelot! Lancelot/' in his French accent.\nDaffodil came in first, Lancelot second, Mirza third. The child, flushed and with eyes blazing, was curiously serene. His uncle brought him five five-pound notes: four to one.\n\"What am I to do with these?\" he cried, waving them before the boy's eyes.\n\"I suppose we'll talk to Bassett,\" said the boy. \"I expect I have fifteen hundred now: and twenty in reserve: and this twenty.\"\nHis uncle studied him for some moments.\n\"Look here, son!\" he said. \"You're not serious about Bassett and that fifteen hundred, are you?\"\n\"Yes, I am. But it's between you and me, uncle! Honour bright!\"\n\"Honour bright all right, son! But I must talk to Bassett.\"\n\"If you'd like to be a partner, uncle, with Bassett and me, we could all be partners. Only you'd have to promise, honour bright, uncle, not to let it go beyond us three. Bassett and I are lucky, and you must be lucky, because it was your ten shillings I started winning with . . .\"\nUncle Oscar took both Bassett and Paul into Richmond Park for an afternoon, and there they talked.\n\"It's like this, you see, sir,\" Bassett said. \"Master Paul would get me talking about racing events, spinning yarns, you know, sir. And he was always keen on knowing if I'd made or if I'd lost. It's about a year since, now, that I put five shillings on Blush of Dawn for him: and we lost. Then the luck turned, with that ten shillings he had from you: that we put on Singhalese. And since that time, it's been pretty steady, all things considering. What do you say, Master Paul?\"\n\"We're all right when we're sure,\" said Paul. \"It's when we're not quite sure that we go down.\"\n\"Oh, but we're careful then,\" said Bassett.\n\"But when are you sure?\" smiled Uncle Oscar.\n\"It's Master Paul, sir,\" said Bassett, in a secret, religious voice. \"It's as if he had it from heaven. Like Daffodil now, for the Lincoln. That was as sure as eggs.\"\n\"Did you put anything on Daffodil?\" asked Oscar Cresswell.\n\"Yes, sir. I made my bit.\"\n\"And my nephew?\"\nBassett was obstinately silent, looking at Paul.\n\"I made twelve hundred, didn't I, Bassett? I told uncle I was putting three hundred on Daffodil.\"\n\"That's right,\" said Bassett, nodding.\n\"But where's the money?\" asked the uncle.\n\"I keep it safe locked up, sir. Master Paul, he can have it any minute he likes to ask for it.\"\n\"What, fifteen hundred pounds?\"\n\"And twenty! And forty, that is, with the twenty he made on the course.\"\n\"It's amazing!\" said the uncle.\n\"If Master Paul offers you to be partners, sir, I would, if I were you: if you'll excuse me,\" said Bassett.\nOscar Cresswell thought about it.\n\"I'll see the money,\" he said.\nThey drove home again, and sure enough, Bassett came round to the garden-house with fifteen hundred pounds in notes. The twenty pounds reserve was left with Joe Glee, in the Turf Commission deposit.\n\"You see, it's all right, uncle, when I'm sure! Then we go strong, for all we're worth. Don't we, Bassett?\"\n\"We do that, Master Paul.\"\n\"And when are you sure?\" said the uncle, laughing.\n\"Oh, well, sometimes I'm absolutely sure, like about Daffodil,\" said the boy; \"and sometimes I have an idea; and sometimes I haven't even an idea, have I, Bassett? Then we're careful, because we mostly go down.\"\n\"You do, do you! And when you're sure, like about Daffodil, what makes you sure, sonny?\"\n\"Oh, well, I don't know,\" said the boy uneasily. \"I'm sure, you know, uncle; that's all.\"\n\"It's as if he had it from heaven, sir,\" Bassett reiterated.\n\"I should say so!\" said the uncle.\nBut he became a partner. And when the Leger was coming on, Paul was \"sure\" about Lively Spark, which was a quite inconsiderable horse. The boy insisted on putting a thousand on the horse, Bassett went for five hundred, and Oscar Cresswell two hundred. Lively Spark came in first, and the betting had been ten to one against him. Paul had made ten thousand.\n\"You see,\" he said, \"I was absolutely sure of him.\"\nEven Oscar Cresswell had cleared two thousand.\n\"Look here, son,\" he said, \"this sort of thing makes me nervous.\"\n\"It needn't, uncle! Perhaps I shan't be sure again for a long time.\"\n\"But what are you going to do with your money?\" asked the uncle.\n\"Of course,\" said the boy, \"I started it for mother. She said she had no luck, because father is unlucky, so I thought if I was lucky, it might stop whispering.\"\n\"What might stop whispering?\"\n\"Our house! I hate our house for whispering.\"\n\"What does it whisper?\"\n\"Why--why\"--the boy fidgeted--\"why, I don't know! But it's always short of money, you know, uncle.\"\n\"I know it, son, I know it.\"\n\"You know people send mother writs, don't you, uncle?\"\n\"I'm afraid I do,\" said the uncle.\n\"And then the house whispers like people laughing at you behind your back. It's awful, that is! I thought if I was lucky--\"\n\"You might stop it,\" added the uncle.\nThe boy watched him with big blue eyes, that had an uncanny cold fire in them, and he said never a word.\n\"Well then!\" said the uncle. \"What are we doing?\"\n\"I shouldn't like mother to know I was lucky,\" said the boy.\n\"Why not, son?\"\n\"She'd stop me.\"\n\"I don't think she would.\"\n\"Oh!\"--and the boy writhed in an odd way--\"I don't want her to know, uncle.\"\n\"All right, son! We'll manage it without her knowing.\"\nThey managed it very easily. Paul, at the other's suggestion, handed over five thousand pounds to his uncle, who deposited it with the family lawyer, who was then to inform Paul's mother that a relative had put five thousand pounds into his hands, which sum was to be paid out a thousand pounds at a time, on the mother's birthday, for the next five years.\n\"So she'll have a birthday present of a thousand pounds for five successive years,\" said Uncle Oscar. \"I hope it won't make it all the harder for her later.\"\nPaul's mother had her birthday in November. The house had been \"whispering\" worse than ever lately, and even in spite of his luck, Paul could not bear up against it. He was very anxious to see the effect of the birthday letter, telling his mother about the thousand pounds.\nWhen there were no visitors, Paul now took his meals with his parents, as he was beyond the nursery control. His mother went into town nearly every day. She had discovered that she had an odd knack of sketching furs and dress materials, so she worked secretly in the studio of a friend who was the chief \"artist\" for the leading drapers. She drew the figures of ladies in furs and ladies in silk and sequins for the newspaper advertisements. This young woman artist earned several thousand pounds a year, but Paul's mother only made several hundreds, and she was again dissatisfied. She so wanted to be first in something, and she did not succeed, even in making sketches for drapery advertisements.\nShe was down to breakfast on the morning of her birthday. Paul watched her face as she read her letters. He knew the lawyer's letter. As his mother read it, her face hardened and became more expressionless. Then a cold, determined look came on her mouth. She hid the letter under the pile of others, and said not a word about it.\n\"Didn't you have anything nice in the post for your birthday, mother?\" said Paul.\n\"Quite moderately nice,\" she said, her voice cold and absent.\nShe went away to town without saying more.\nBut in the afternoon Uncle Oscar appeared. He said Paul's mother had had a long interview with the lawyer, asking if the whole five thousand could not be advanced at once, as she was in debt.\n\"What do you think, uncle?\" said the boy.\n\"I leave it to you, son.\"\n\"Oh, let her have it, then! We can get some more with the other,\" said the boy.\n\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, laddie!\" said Uncle Oscar.\n\"But I'm sure to know for the Grand National; or the Lincolnshire; or else the Derby. I'm sure to know for one of them,\" said Paul.\nSo Uncle Oscar signed the agreement, and Paul's mother touched the whole five thousand. Then something very curious happened. The voices in the house suddenly went mad, like a chorus of frogs on a spring evening. There were certain new furnishings, and Paul had a tutor. He was really going to Eton, his father's school, in the following autumn. There were flowers in the winter, and a blossoming of the luxury Paul's mother had been used to. And yet the voices in the house, behind the sprays of mimosa and almond-blossom, and from under the piles of iridescent cushions, simply trilled and screamed in a sort of ecstasy: \"There must be more money! Oh-h-h! There must be more money! Oh, now, now-w! now-w-w--there must be more money!--more than ever! More than ever!\"\nIt frightened Paul terribly. He studied away at his Latin and Greek with his tutors. But his intense hours were spent with Bassett. The Grand National had gone by: he had not \"known\", and had lost a hundred pounds. Summer was at hand. He was in agony for the Lincoln. But even for the Lincoln he didn't \"know\", and he lost fifty pounds. He became wild-eyed and strange, as if something were going to explode in him.\n\"Let it alone, son! Don't you bother about it!\" urged Uncle Oscar. But it was as if the boy couldn't really hear what his uncle was saying.\n\"I've got to know for the Derby! I've got to know for the Derby!\" the child reiterated, his big blue eyes blazing with a sort of madness.\nHis mother noticed how overwrought he was.\n\"You'd better go to the seaside. Wouldn't you like to go now to the seaside, instead of waiting? I think you'd better,\" she said, looking down at him anxiously, her heart curiously heavy because of him.\nBut the child lifted his uncanny blue eyes.\n\"I couldn't possibly go before the Derby, mother!\" he said. \"I couldn't possibly!\"\n\"Why not?\" she said, her voice becoming heavy when she was opposed. \"Why not? You can still go from the seaside to see the Derby with your Uncle Oscar, if that's what you wish. No need for you to wait here. Besides, I think you care too much about these races. It's a bad sign. My family has been a gambling family, and you won't know till you grow up how much damage it has done. But it has done damage. I shall have to send Bassett away, and ask Uncle Oscar not to talk racing to you, unless you promise to be reasonable about it: go away to the seaside and forget it. You're all nerves!\"\n\"I'll do what you like, mother, so long as you don't send me away till after the Derby,\" the boy said.\n\"Send you away from where? Just from this house?\"\n\"Yes,\" he said, gazing at her.\n\"Why, you curious child, what makes you care about this house so much, suddenly? I never knew you loved it!\"\nHe gazed at her without speaking. He had a secret within a secret, something he had not divulged, even to Bassett or to his Uncle Oscar.\nBut his mother, after standing undecided and a little bit sullen for some moments, said:\n\"Very well, then! Don't go to the seaside till after the Derby, if you don't wish it. But promise me you won't let your nerves go to pieces! Promise you won't think so much about horse-racing and events, as you call them!\"\n\"Oh no!\" said the boy, casually. \"I won't think much about them, mother. You needn't worry. I wouldn't worry, mother, if I were you.\"\n\"If you were me and I were you,\" said his mother, \"I wonder what we should do!\"\n\"But you know you needn't worry, mother, don't you?\" the boy repeated.\n\"I should be awfully glad to know it,\" she said wearily.\n\"Oh, well, you can, you know. I mean you ought to know you needn't worry!\" he insisted.\n\"Ought I? Then I'll see about it,\" she said.\nPaul's secret of secrets was his wooden horse, that which had no name. Since he was emancipated from a nurse and a nursery governess, he had had his rocking-horse removed to his own bedroom at the top of the house.\n\"Surely you're too big for a rocking-horse!\" his mother had remonstrated.\n\"Well, you see, mother, till I can have a real horse, I like to have some sort of animal about,\" had been his quaint answer.\n\"Do you feel he keeps you company?\" she laughed.\n\"Oh yes! He's very good, he always keeps me company, when I'm there,\" said Paul.\nSo the horse, rather shabby, stood in an arrested prance in the boy's bedroom.\nThe Derby was drawing near, and the boy grew more and more tense. He hardly heard what was spoken to him, he was very frail, and his eyes were really uncanny. His mother had sudden strange seizures of uneasiness about him. Sometimes, for half an hour, she would feel a sudden anxiety about him that was almost anguish. She wanted to rush to him at once, and know he was safe.\nTwo nights before the Derby, she was at a big party in town, when one of her rushes of anxiety about her boy, her first-born, gripped her heart till she could hardly speak. She fought with the feeling, might and main, for she believed in common-sense. But it was too strong. She had to leave the dance and go downstairs to telephone to the country. The children's nursery governess was terribly surprised and startled at being rung up in the night.\n\"Are the children all right, Miss Wilmot?\"\n\"Oh yes, they are quite all right.\"\n\"Master Paul? Is he all right?\"\n\"He went to bed as right as a trivet. Shall I run up and look at him?\"\n\"No!\" said Paul's mother reluctantly. \"No! Don't trouble. It's all right. Don't sit up. We shall be home fairly soon.\" She did not want her son's privacy intruded upon.\n\"Very good,\" said the governess.\nIt was about one o'clock when Paul's mother and father drove up to their house. All was still. Paul's mother went to her room and slipped off her white fur cloak. She had told her maid not to wait up for her. She heard her husband downstairs, mixing a whisky-and-soda.\nAnd then, because of the strange anxiety at her heart, she stole upstairs to her son's room. Noiselessly she went along the upper corridor. Was there a faint noise? What was it?\nShe stood, with arrested muscles, outside his door, listening. There was a strange, heavy, and yet not loud noise. Her heart stood still. It was a soundless noise, yet rushing and powerful. Something huge, in violent, hushed motion. What was it? What in God's Name was it? She ought to know. She felt that she knew the noise. She knew what it was.\nYet she could not place it. She couldn't say what it was. And on and on it went, like a madness.\nSoftly, frozen with anxiety and fear, she turned the door-handle.\nThe room was dark. Yet in the space near the window, she heard and saw something plunging to and fro. She gazed in fear and amazement.\nThen suddenly she switched on the light, and saw her son, in his green pyjamas, madly surging on his rocking-horse. The blaze of light suddenly lit him up, as he urged the wooden horse, and lit her up, as she stood, blonde, in her dress of pale green and crystal, in the doorway.\n\"Paul!\" she cried. \"Whatever are you doing?\"\n\"It's Malabar!\" he screamed, in a powerful, strange voice. \"It's Malabar!\"\nHis eyes blazed at her for one strange and senseless second, as he ceased urging his wooden horse. Then he fell with a crash to the ground, and she, all her tormented motherhood flooding upon her, rushed to gather him up.\nBut he was unconscious, and unconscious he remained, with some brain-fever. He talked and tossed, and his mother sat stonily by his side.\n\"Malabar! It's Malabar! Bassett, Bassett, I know: it's Malabar!\"\nSo the child cried, trying to get up and urge the rocking-horse that gave him his inspiration.\n\"What does he mean by Malabar?\" asked the heart-frozen mother.\n\"I don't know,\" said the father, stonily.\n\"What does he mean by Malabar?\" she asked her brother Oscar.\n\"It's one of the horses running for the Derby,\" was the answer.\nAnd, in spite of himself, Oscar Cresswell spoke to Bassett, and himself put a thousand on Malabar: at fourteen to one.\nThe third day of the illness was critical: they were watching for a change. The boy, with his rather long, curly hair, was tossing ceaselessly on the pillow. He neither slept nor regained consciousness, and his eyes were like blue stones. His mother sat, feeling her heart had gone, turned actually into a stone.\nIn the evening, Oscar Cresswell did not come, but Bassett sent a message, saying could he come up for one moment, just one moment? Paul's mother was very angry at the intrusion, but on second thoughts she agreed. The boy was the same. Perhaps Bassett might bring him to consciousness.\nThe gardener, a shortish fellow with a little brown moustache and sharp little brown eyes, tiptoed into the room, touched his imaginary cap to Paul's mother, and stole to the bedside, staring with glittering, smallish eyes at the tossing, dying child.\n\"Master Paul!\" he whispered. \"Master Paul! Malabar came in first all right, a clean win. I did as you told me. You've made over seventy thousand pounds, you have; you've got over eighty thousand. Malabar came in all right, Master Paul.\"\n\"Malabar! Malabar! Did I say Malabar, mother? Did I say Malabar? Do you think I'm lucky, mother? I knew Malabar, didn't I? Over eighty thousand pounds! I call that lucky, don't you, mother? Over eighty thousand pounds! I knew, didn't I know I knew? Malabar came in all right. If I ride my horse till I'm sure, then I tell you, Basset, you can go as high as you like. Did you go for all you were worth, Bassett?\"\n\"I went a thousand on it, Master Paul.\"\n\"I never told you, mother, that if I can ride my horse, and get there, then I'm absolutely sure--oh, absolutely! Mother, did I ever tell you? I am lucky!\"\n\"No, you never did,\" said the mother.\nBut the boy died in the night.\nAnd even as he lay dead, his mother heard her brother's voice saying to her: \"My God, Hester, you're eighty-odd thousand to the good, and a poor devil of a son to the bad. But, poor devil, poor devil, he's best gone out of a life where he rides his rocking-horse to find a winner.\"\n"

                "content": "\nThis blind man, an old friend of my wife's, he was on his way to spend the night. His wife had died. So he was visiting the dead wife's relatives in Connecticut. He called my wife from his in-laws'. Arrangements were made. He would come by train, a five-hour trip, and my wife would meet him at the station. She hadn't seen him since she worked for him one summer in Seattle ten years ago. But she and the blind man had kept in touch. They made tapes and mailed them back and forth. I wasn't enthusiastic about his visit. He was no one I knew. And his being blind bothered me. My idea of blindness came from the movies. IIn the movies, the blind moved slowly and never laughed. Sometimes they were led by seeing-eye dogs. A blind man in my house was not something I looked forward to.\nThat summer in Seattle she had needed a job. She didn't have any money. The man she was going to marry at the end of the summer was in officers' training school. He didn't have any money, either. But she was in love with the guy, and he was in love with her, etc. She'd seen something in the paper: HELP WANTED--Reading to Blind Man, and a telephone number. She phoned and went over, was hired on the spot. She'd worked with this blind man all summer. She read stuff to him, case studies, reports, that sort of thing. She helped him organize his little office in the county social-service department. They'd become good friends, my wife and the blind man. How do I know these things? She told me. And she told me something else. On her last day in the office, the blind man asked if he could touch her face. She agreed to this. She told me he touched his fingers to every part of her face, her nose--even her neck! She never forgot it. She even tried to write a poem about it. She was always trying to write a poem. She wrote a poem or two every year, usually after something really important had happened to her.\nWhen we first started going out together, she showed me the poem. In the poem, she recalled his fingers and the way they had moved around over her face. In the poem, she talked about what she had felt at the time, about what went through her mind when the blind man touched her nose and lips. I can remember I didn't think much of the poem. Of course, I didn't tell her that. Maybe I just don't understand poetry. I admit it's not the first thing I reach for when I pick up something to read.\nAnyway, this man who'd first enjoyed her favors, the officer-to-be, he'd been her childhood sweetheart. So okay. I'm saying that at the end of the summer she let the blind man run his hands over her face, said goodbye to him, married her childhood etc., who was now a commissioned officer, and she moved away from Seattle. But they'd kept in touch, she and the blind man. She made the first contact after a year or so. She called him up one night from an Air Force base in Alabama. She wanted to talk. They talked. He asked her to send him a tape and tell him about her life. She did this. She sent the tape. On the tape, she told the blind man about her husband and about their life together in the military. She told the blind man she loved her husband but she didn't like it where they lived and she didn't like it that he was a part of the military-industrial thing. She told the blind man she'd written a poem and he was in it. She told him that she was writing a poem about what it was like to be an Air Force officer's wife. The poem wasn't finished yet. She was still writing it. The blind man made a tape. He sent her the tape. She made a tape. This went on for years. My wife's officer was posted to one base and then another. She sent tapes from Moody AFB, McGuire, McConnell, and finally Travis, near Sacramento, where one night she got to feeling lonely and cut off from people she kept losing in that moving-around life. She got to feeling she couldn't go it another step. She went in and swallowed all the pills and capsules in the medicine chest and washed them down with a bottle of gin. Then she got into a hot bath and passed out.\nBut instead of dying, she got sick. She threw up. Her officer--why should he have a name? he was the childhood sweetheart, and what more does he want?--came home from somewhere, found her, and called the ambulance. In time, she put it all on a tape and sent the tape to the blind man. Over the years, she put all kinds of stuff on tapes and sent the tapes off lickety-split. Next to writing a poem every year, I think it was her chief means of recreation. On one tape, she told the blind man she'd decided to live away from her officer for a time. On another tape, she told him about her divorce. She and I began going out, and of course she told her blind man about it. She told him everything, or so it seemed to me. Once she asked me if I'd like to hear the latest tape from the blind man. This was a year ago. I was on the tape, she said. So I said okay, I'd listen to it. I got us drinks and we settled down in the living room. We made ready to listen. First she inserted the tape into the player and adjusted a couple of dials. Then she pushed a lever. The tape squeaked and someone began to talk in this loud voice. She lowered the volume. After a few minutes of harmless chitchat, I heard my own name in the mouth of this stranger, this blind man I didn't even know! And then this: \"From all you've said about him, I can only conclude--\" But we were interrupted, a knock at the door, something, and we didn't ever get back to the tape. Maybe it was just as well. I'd heard all I wanted to.\nNow this same blind man was coming to sleep in my house.\n\"Maybe I could take him bowling,\" I said to my wife. She was at the draining board doing scalloped potatoes. She put down the knife she was using and turned around.\n\"If you love me,\" she said, \"you can do this for me. If you don't love me, okay. But if you had a friend, any friend, and the friend came to visit, I'd make him feel comfortable.\" She wiped her hands with the dish towel.\n\"I don't have any blind friends,\" I said.\n\"You don't have any friends,\" she said. \"Period. Besides,\" she said, \"goddamn it, his wife's just died! Don't you understand that? The man's lost his wife!\"\nI didn't answer. She'd told me a little about the blind man's wife. Her name was Beulah. Beulah! That's a name for a colored woman.\n\"Was his wife a Negro?\" I asked.\n\"Are you crazy?\" my wife said. \"Have you just flipped or something?\" She picked up a potato. I saw it hit the floor, then roll under the stove. \"What's wrong with you?\" she said. \"Are you drunk?\"\n\"I'm just asking,\" I said.\nRight then my wife filled me in with more detail than I cared to know. I made a drink and sat at the kitchen table to listen. Pieces of the story began to fall into place.\nBeulah had gone to work for the blind man the summer after my wife had stopped working for him. Pretty soon Beulah and the blind man had themselves a church wedding. It was a little wedding--who'd want to go to such a wedding in the first place?--just the two of them, plus the minister and the minister's wife. But it was a church wedding just the same. It was what Beulah had wanted, he'd said. But even then Beulah must have been carrying the cancer in her glands. After they had been inseparable for eight years--my wife's word, inseparable--Beulah's health went into a rapid decline. She died in a Seattle hospital room, the blind man sitting beside the bed and holding on to her hand. They'd married, lived and worked together, slept together--had sex, sure--and then the blind man had to bury her. All this without his having ever seen what the goddamned woman looked like. It was beyond my understanding. Hearing this, I felt sorry for the blind man for a little bit. And then I found myself thinking what a pitiful life this woman must have led. Imagine a woman who could never see herself as she was seen in the eyes of her loved one. A woman who could go on day after day and never receive the smallest compliment from her beloved. A woman whose husband could never read the expression on her face, be it misery or something better. Someone who could wear makeup or not--what difference to him? She could, if she wanted, wear green eye-shadow around one eye, a straight pin in her nostril, yellow slacks, and purple shoes, no matter. And then to slip off into death, the blind man's hand on her hand, his blind eyes streaming tears--I'm imagining now--her last thought maybe this: that he never even knew what she looked like, and she on an express to the grave. Robert was left with a small insurance policy and a half of a twenty-peso Mexican coin. The other half of the coin went into the box with her. Pathetic.\nSo when the time rolled around, my wife went to the depot to pick him up. With nothing to do but wait--sure, I blamed him for that--I was having a drink and watching the TV when I heard the car pull into the drive. I got up from the sofa with my drink and went to the window to have a look.\nI saw my wife laughing as she parked the car. I saw her get out of the car and shut the odor. She was still wearing a smile. Just amazing. She went around to the other side of the car to where the blind man was already starting to get out. This blind man, feature this, he was wearing a full beard! A beard on a blind man! Too much, I say. The blind man reached into the back seat and dragged out a suitcase. My wife took his arm, shut the car door, and, talking all the way, moved him down the drive and then up the steps to the front porch. I turned off the TV. I finished my drink, rinsed the glass, dried my hands. Then I went to the door.\nMy wife said, \"I want you to meet Robert. Robert, this is my husband. I've told you all about him.\" She was beaming. She had this blind man by his coat sleeve.\nThe blind man let go of his suitcase and up came his hand. I took it. He squeezed hard, held my hand, and then he let it go.\n\"I feel like we've already met,\" he boomed.\n\"Likewise,\" I said. I didn't know what else to say. Then I said, \"Welcome. I've heard a lot about you.\" We began to move then, a little group, from the porch into the living room, my wife guiding him by the arm. The blind man was carrying his suitcase in his other hand. My wife said things like, \"To your left here, Robert. That's right. Now watch it, there's a chair. That's it. Sit down right here. This is the sofa. We just bought this sofa two weeks ago.\"\nI started to say something about the old sofa. I'd liked that old sofa. But I didn't say anything. Then I wanted to say something else, small-talk, about the scenic ride along the Hudson. How going to New York, you should sit on the right-hand side of the train, and coming from New York, the left-hand side.\n\"Did you have a good train ride?\" I said. \"Which side of the train did you sit on, by the way?\"\n\"What a question, which side!\" my wife said. \"What's it matter which side?\" she said.\n\"I just asked,\" I said.\n\"Right side,\" the blind man said. \"I hadn't been on a train in nearly forty years. Not since I was a kid. With my folks. That's been a long time. I'd nearly forgotten the sensation. I have winter in my beard now,\" he said. \"So I've been told, anyway. Do I look distinguished, my dear?\" the blind man said to my wife.\n\"You look distinguished, Robert,\" she said. \"Robert,\" she said. \"Robert, it's just so good to see you.\"\nMy wife finally took her eyes off the blind man and looked at me. I had the feeling she didn't like what she saw. I shrugged.\nI've never met, or personally known, anyone who was blind. This blind man was late forties, a heavy-set, balding man with stooped shoulders, as if he carried a great weight there. He wore brown slacks, brown shoes, a light-brown shirt, a tie, a sports coat. Spiffy. He also had this full beard. But he didn't use a cane and he didn't wear dark glasses. I'd always thought dark glasses were a must for the blind. Fact was, I wished he had a pair. At first glance, his eyes looked like anyone else's eyes. But if you looked close, there was something different about them. Too much white in the iris, for one thing, and the pupils seemed to move around in the sockets without his knowing it or being able to stop it. Creepy. As I stared at his face, I saw the left pupil turn in toward his nose while the other made an effort to keep in one place. But it was only an effort, for that eye was on the roam without his knowing it or wanting it to be.\nI said, \"Let me get you a drink. What's your pleasure? We have a little of everything. It's one of our pastimes.\"\n\"Bub, I'm a Scotch man myself,\" he said fast enough in this big voice.\n\"Right,\" I said. Bub! \"Sure you are. I knew it.\"\nHe let his fingers touch his suitcase, which was sitting alongside the sofa. He was taking his bearings. I didn't blame him for that.\n\"I'll move that up to your room,\" my wife said.\n\"No, that's fine,\" the blind man said loudly. \"It can go up when I go up.\"\n\"A little water with the Scotch?\" I said.\n\"Very little,\" he said.\n\"I knew it,\" I said.\nHe said, \"Just a tad. The Irish actor, Barry Fitzgerald? I'm like that fellow. When I drink water, Fitzgerald said, I drink water. When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey.\" My wife laughed. The blind man brought his hand up under his beard. He lifted his beard slowly and let it drop.\nI did the drinks, three big glasses of Scotch with a splash of water in each. Then we made ourselves comfortable and talked about Robert's travels. First the long flight from the West Coast to Connecticut, we covered that. Then from Connecticut up here by train. We had another drink concerning that leg of the trip.\nI remembered having read somewhere that the blind didn't smoke because, as speculation had it, they couldn't see the smoke they exhaled. I thought I knew that much and that much only about blind people. But this blind man smoked his cigarette down to the nubbin and then lit another one. This blind man filled his ashtray and my wife emptied it.\nWhen we sat down at the table for dinner, we had another drink. My wife heaped Robert's plate with cube steak, scalloped potatoes, green beans. I buttered him up two slices of bread. I said, \"Here's bread and butter for you.\" I swallowed some of my drink. \"Now let us pray,\" I said, and the blind man lowered his head. My wife looked at me, her mouth agape. \"Pray the phone won't ring and the food doesn't get cold,\" I said.\nWe dug in. We ate everything there was to eat on the table. We ate like there was no tomorrow. We didn't talk. We ate. We scarfed. We grazed that table. We were into serious eating. The blind man had right away located his foods, he knew just where everything was on his plate. I watched with admiration as he used his knife and fork on the meat. He'd cut two pieces of meat, fork the meat into his mouth, and then go all out for the scalloped potatoes, the beans next, and then he'd tear off a hunk of buttered bread and eat that. He'd follow this up with a big drink of milk. It didn't seem to bother him to use his fingers once in a while, either.\nWe finished everything, including half a strawberry pie. For a few moments, we sat as if stunned. Sweat beaded on our faces. Finally, we got up from the table and left the dirty places. We didn't look back. We took ourselves into the living room and sank into our places again. Robert and my wife sat on the sofa. I took the big chair. We had us two or three more drinks while they talked about the major things that had come to pass for them in the past ten years. For the most part, I just listened. Now and then I joined in. I didn't want him to think I'd left the room, and I didn't want her to think I was feeling left out. They talked of things that had happened to them--to them!--these past ten years. I waited in vain to hear my name on my wife's sweet lips: \"And then my dear husband came into my life\"--something like that. But I heard nothing of the sort. More talk of Robert. Robert had done a little of everything, it seemed, a regular blind jack-of-all-trades. But most recently he and his wife had had an Amway distributorship, from which, I gathered, they'd earned their living, such as it was. The blind man was also a ham radio operator. He talked in his loud voice about conversations he'd had with fellow operators in Guam, in the Philippines, in Alaska, and even in Tahiti. He said he'd have a lot of friends there if he ever wanted to go visit those places. From time to time, he'd turn his blind face toward me, put his hand under his beard, ask me something. How long had I been in my present position? (Three years.) Did I like my work? (I didn't.) Was I going to stay with it? (What were the options?) Finally, when I thought he was beginning to run down, I got up and turned on the TV.\nMy wife looked at me with irritation. She was heading toward a boil. Then she looked at the blind man and said, \"Robert, do you have a TV?\"\nThe blind man said, \"My dear, I have two TVs. I have a color set and a black-and-white thing, an old relic. It's funny, but if I turn the TV on, and I'm always turning it on, I turn on the color set. It's funny, don't you think?\"\nI didn't know what to say to that. I had absolutely nothing to say to that. No opinion. So I watched the news program and tried to listen to what the announcer was saying.\n\"This is a color TV,\" the blind man said. \"Don't ask me how, but I can tell.\"\n\"We traded up a while ago,\" I said.\nThe blind man had another taste of his drink. He lifted his beard, sniffed it, and let it fall. He leaned forward on the sofa. He positioned his ashtray on the coffee table, then put the lighter to his cigarette. He leaned back on the sofa and crossed his legs at the ankles.\nMy wife covered her mouth, and then she yawned. She stretched. She said, \"I think I'll go upstairs and put on my robe. I think I'll change into something else. Robert, you make yourself comfortable,\" she said.\n\"I'm comfortable,\" the blind man said.\n\"I want you to feel comfortable in this house,\" she said.\n\"I am comfortable,\" the blind man said.\nAfter she'd left the room, he and I listened to the weather report and then to the sports roundup. By that time, she'd been gone so long I didn't know if she was going to come back. I thought she might have gone to bed. I wished she'd come back downstairs. I didn't want to be left alone with a blind man. I asked him if he wanted another drink, and he said sure. Then I asked if he wanted to smoke some dope with me. I said I'd just rolled a number. I hadn't, but I planned to do so in about two shakes.\n\"I'll try some with you,\" he said.\n\"Damn right,\" I said. \"That's the stuff.\"\nI got our drinks and sat down on the sofa with him. Then I rolled us two fat numbers. I lit one and passed it. I brought it to his fingers. He took it and inhaled.\n\"Hold it as long as you can,\" I said. I could tell he didn't know the first thing.\nMy wife came back downstairs wearing her pink robe and her pink slippers.\n\"What do I smell?\" she said.\n\"We thought we'd have us some cannabis,\" I said.\nMy wife gave me a savage look. Then she looked at the blind man and said, \"Robert, I didn't know you smoked.\"\nHe said, \"I do now, my dear. There's a first time for everything. But I don't feel anything yet.\"\n\"This stuff is pretty mellow,\" I said. \"This stuff is mild. It's dope you can reason with,\" I said. \"I t doesn't mess you up.\"\n\"Not much it doesn't, bub,\" he said, and laughed.\nMy wife sat on the sofa between the blind man and me. I passed her the number. She took it and toked and then passed it back to me. \"Which way is this going?\" she said. Then she said, \"I shouldn't be smoking this. I can hardly keep my eyes open as it is. That dinner did me in. I shouldn't have eaten so much.\"\n\"It was the strawberry pie,\" the blind man said. \"That's what did it,\" he said, and he laughed his big laugh. Then he shook his head.\n\"There's more strawberry pie,\" I said.\n\"Do you want some more, Robert?\" my wife said.\n\"Maybe in a little while,\" he said.\nWe gave our attention to the TV. My wife yawned again. She said, \"Your bed is made up when you feel like going to bed, Robert. I know you must have had a long day. When you're ready to go to bed, say so.\" She pulled his arm. \"Robert?\"\nHe came to and said, \"I've had a real nice time. This beats tapes doesn't it?\"\nI said, \"Coming at you,\" and I put the number between his fingers. He inhaled, held the smoke, and then let it go. It was like he'd been doing it since he was nine years old.\n\"Thanks, bub,\" he said. \"But I think this is all for me. I think I'm beginning to feel it,\" he said. He held the burning roach out for my wife.\n\"Same here,\" she said. \"Ditto. Me, too.\" She took the roach and passed it to me. \"I may just sit here for a while between you two guys with my eyes closed. But don't let me bother you, okay? Either one of you. If it bothers you, say so. Otherwise, I may just sit here with my eyes closed until you're ready to go to bed,\" she said. \"Your bed's made up, Robert, when you're ready. It's right next to our room at the top of the stairs. We'll show you up when you're ready. You wake me up now, you guys, if I fall asleep.\" She said that and then she closed her eyes and went to sleep.\nThe news program ended. I got up and changed the channel. I sat back down on the sofa. I wished my wife hadn't pooped out. Her head lay across the back of the sofa, her mouth open. She'd turned so that her robe slipped away from her legs, exposing a juicy thigh. I reached to draw her robe back over her, and it was then that I glanced at the blind man. What the hell! I flipped the rope open again.\n\"You say when you want some strawberry pie,\" I said.\n\"I will,\" he said.\nI said, \"Are you tired? Do you want me to take you up to your bed? Are you ready to hit the hay?\"\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"No, I'll stay up with you, bub. If that's all right. I'll stay up until you're ready to turn in. We haven't had a chance to talk. Know what I mean? I feel like me and her monopolized the evening.\" He lifted his beard and he let it fall. He picked up his cigarettes and his lighter.\n\"That's all right,\" I said. Then I said, \"I'm glad for the company.\"\nAnd I guess I was. Every night I smoked dope and stayed up as long as I could before I fell asleep. My wife and I hardly ever went to bed at the same time. When I did go to sleep, I had these dreams. Sometimes I'd wake up from one of them, my heart going crazy.\nSomething about the church and the Middle Ages was on the TV. Not your run-of-the-mill TV fare. I wanted to watch something else. I turned to the other channels. But there was nothing on them, either. So I turned back to the first channel and apologized.\n\"Bub, it's all right,\" the blind man said. \"It's fine with me. Whatever you want to watch is okay. I'm always learning something. Learning never ends. It won't hurt me to learn something tonight, I got ears,\" he said.\nWe didn't say anything for a time. He was leaning forward with his head turned at me, his right ear aimed in the direction of the set. Very disconcerting. Now and then his eyelids drooped and then they snapped open again. Now and then he put his fingers into his beard and tugged, like he was thinking about something he was hearing on the television.\nOn the screen, a group of men wearing cowls was being set upon and tormented by men dressed in skeleton costumes and men dressed as devils. The men dressed as devils wore devil masks, horns, and long tails. This pageant was part of a procession. The Englishman who was narrating the thing said it took place in Spain once a year. I tried to explain to the blind man what was happening.\n\"Skeletons,\" he said. \"I know about skeletons,\" he said, and he nodded.\nThe TV showed this one cathedral. Then there was a long, slow look at another one. Finally, the picture switched to the famous one in Paris, with its flying buttresses and its spires reaching up to the clouds. The camera pulled away to show the whole of the cathedral rising above the skyline.\nThere were times when the Englishman who was telling the thing would shut up, would simply let the camera move around the cathedrals. Or else the camera would tour the countryside, men in fields walking behind oxen. I waited as long as I could. Then I felt I had to say something. I said, \"They're showing the outside of this cathedral now. Gargoyles. Little statues carved to look like monsters. Now I guess they're in Italy. Yeah, they're in Italy. There's paintings on the walls of this one church.\"\n\"Are those fresco paintings, bub?\" he asked, and he sipped from his drink.\nI reached for my glass. But it was empty. I tried to remember what I could remember. \"You're asking me are those frescoes?\" I said. \"That's a good question. I don't know.\"\nThe camera moved to a cathedral outside Lisbon. The differences in the Portuguese cathedral compared with the French and Italian were not that great. But they were there. Mostly the interior stuff. Then something occurred to me, and I said, \"Something has occurred to me. Do you have any idea what a cathedral is? What they look like, that is? Do you follow me? If somebody says cathedral to you, do you have any notion what they're talking about? Do you know the difference between that and a Baptist church, say?\"\nHe let the smoke dribble from his mouth. \"I know they took hundreds of workers fifty or a hundred years to build,\" he said. \"I just heard the man say that, of course. I know generations of the same families worked on a cathedral. I heard him say that, too. The men who began their life's work on them, they never lived to see the completion of their work. In that wise, bub, they're no different from the rest of us, right?\" He laughed. Then his eyelids drooped again. His head nodded. He seemed to be snoozing. Maybe he was imagining himself in Portugal. The TV was showing another cathedral now. This one was in Germany. The Englishman's voice droned on. \"Cathedrals,\" the blind man said. He sat up and rolled his head back and forth. \"If you want the truth, bub, that's about all I know. What I just said. What I heard him say. But maybe you could describe one to me? I wish you'd do it. I'd like that. If you want to know, I really don't have a good idea.\"\nI stared hard at the shot of the cathedral on the TV. How could I even begin to describe it? But say my life depended on it. Say my life was being threatened by an insane guy who said I had to do it or else.\nI stared some more at the cathedral before the picture flipped off into the countryside. There was no use. I turned to the blind man and said, \"To begin with, they're very tall.\" I was looking around the room for clues. \"They reach way up. Up and up. Toward the sky. They're so big, some of them, they have to have these supports. To help hold them up, so to speak. These supports are called buttresses. They remind me of viaducts, for some reason. But maybe you don't know viaducts, either? Sometimes the cathedrals have devils and such carved into the front. Sometimes lords and ladies. Don't ask me why this is,\" I said.\nHe was nodding. The whole upper part of his body seemed to be moving back and forth.\n\"I'm not doing so good, am I?\" I said.\nHe stopped nodding and leaned forward on the edge of the sofa. As he listened to me, he was running his fingers through his beard. I wasn't getting through to him, I could see that. But he waited for me to go on just the same. He nodded, like he was trying to encourage me. I tried to think what else to say. \"They're really big,\" I said. \"They're massive. They're built of stone. Marble, too, sometimes. In those olden days, when they built cathedrals, men wanted to be close to God. In those olden days, God was an important part of everyone's life. You could tell this from their cathedral-building. I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but it looks like that's the best I can do for you. I'm just no good at it.\"\n\"That's all right, bub,\" the blind man said. \"Hey, listen. I hope you don't mind my asking you. Can I ask you something? Let me ask you a simple question, yes or no. I'm just curious and there's no offense. You're my host. But let me ask if you are in any way religious? You don't mind my asking?\"\nI shook my head. He couldn't see that, though. A wink is the same as a nod to a blind man. \"I guess I don't believe in it. In anything. Sometimes It's hard. You know what I'm saying?\"\n\"Sure, I do,\" he said.\n\"Right,\" I said.\nThe Englishman was still holding forth. My wife sighed in her sleep. She drew a long breath and went on with her sleeping.\n\"You'll have to forgive me,\" I said. \"But I can't tell you what a cathedral looks like. It just isn't in me to do it. I can't do any more than I've done.\"\nThe blind man sat very still, his head down, as he listened to me.\nI said, \"The truth is, cathedrals don't mean anything special to me. Nothing. Cathedrals. They're something to look at on late-night TV. That's all they are.\"\nIt was then that the blind man cleared his throat. He brought something up. He took a handkerchief from his back pocket. Then he said, \"I get it, bub. It's okay. It happens. Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"Hey, listen to me. Will you do me a favor? I got an idea. Why don't you find us some heavy paper? and a pen. We'll do something. We'll draw one together. Get us a pen and some heavy paper. Go on, bub, get the stuff,\" he said.\nSo I went upstairs. My legs felt like they didn't have any strength in them. They felt like they did after I'd done some running. In my wife's room, I looked around. I found some ballpoints in a little basket on her table. And then I tried to think where to look for the kind of paper he was talking about.\nDownstairs, in the kitchen, I found a shopping bag with onion skins in the bottom of the bag. I emptied the bag and shook it. I brought it into the living room and sat down with it near his legs. I moved some things, smoothed the wrinkles from the bag, spread it out on the coffee table.\nThe blind man got down from the sofa and sat next to me on the carpet.\nHe ran his fingers over the paper. He went up and down the sides of the paper. The edges, even the edges. He fingered the corners.\n\"All right,\" he said. \"All right, let's do her.\"\nHe found my hand, the hand with the pen. He closed his hand over my hand. \"Go ahead, bub, draw,\" he said. \"Draw. You'll see. I'll follow along with you. It'll be okay. Just begin now like I'm telling you. You'll see. Draw,\" the blind man said.\nSo I began. First I drew a box that looked like a house. It could have been the house I lived in. Then I put a roof on it. At either end of the roof, I drew spires. Crazy.\n\"Swell,\" he said. \"Terrific. You're doing fine,\" he said. \"Never thought anything like this could happen in your lifetime, did you, bub? Well, it's a strange life, we all know that. Go on now. Keep it up.\"\nI put in windows with arches. I drew flying buttresses. I hung great doors. I couldn't stop. The TV station went off the air. I put down the pen and closed and opened my fingers. The blind man felt around over the paper. He moved the tips of his fingers over the paper, all over what I had drawn, and he nodded.\n\"Doing fine,\" the blind man said.\nI took up the pen again, and he found my hand. I kept at it. I'm no artist. But I kept drawing just the same.\nMy wife opened up her eyes and gazed at us. She sat up on the sofa, her robe hanging open. She said, \"What are you doing? Tell me, I want to know.\"\nI didn't answer her.\nThe blind man said, \"We're drawing a cathedral. Me and him are working on it. Press hard,\" he said to me. \"That's right. That's good,\" he said. \"Sure. You got it, bub, I can tell. You didn't think you could. But you can, can't you? You're cooking with gas now. You know what I'm saying? We're going to really have us something here in a minute. How's the old arm?\" he said. \"Put some people in there now. What's a cathedral without people?\"\nMy wife said, \"What's going on? Robert, what are you doing? What's going on?\"\n\"It's all right,\" he said to her. \"Close your eyes now,\" the blind man said to me.\nI did it. I closed them just like he said.\n\"Are they closed?\" he said. \"Don't fudge.\"\n\"They're closed,\" I said.\n\"Keep them that way,\" he said. He said, \"Don't stop now. Draw.\"\nSo we kept on with it. His fingers rode my fingers as my hand went over the paper. It was like nothing else in my life up to now.\nThen he said, \"I think that's it. I think you got it,\" he said. \"Take a look. What do you think?\"\nBut I had my eyes closed. I thought I'd keep them that way for a little longer. I thought it was something I ought to do.\n\"Well?\" he said. \"Are you looking?\"\nMy eyes were still closed. I was in my house. I knew that. But I didn't feel like I was inside anything.\n\"It's really something,\" I said.\n"

She used the time,\nthough. She read an article in a women's\npocket-size magazine, called \"Sex Is Fun-or\nHell.\" She washed her comb and brush. She\ntook the spot out of the skirt of her beige suit.\nShe moved the button on her Saks blouse. She\ntweezed out two freshly surfaced hairs in her\nmole. When the operator finally rang her room,\nshe was sitting on the window seat and had\nalmost finished putting lacquer on the nails of\nher left hand.\nShe was a girl who for a ringing phone\ndropped exactly nothing. She looked as if her\nphone had been ringing continually ever since\nshe had reached puberty.\nWith her little lacquer brush, while the phone\nwas ringing, she went over the nail of her little\nfinger, accentuating the line of the moon. She\nthen replaced the cap on the bottle of\nlacquer and, standing up, passed her left--the\nwet--hand back and forth through the air. With\nher dry hand, she picked up a congested\nashtray from the window seat and carried it\nwith her over to the night table, on which the\nphone stood. She sat down on one of the\nmade-up twin beds and--it was the fifth or sixth\nring--picked up the phone.\n\"Hello,\" she said, keeping the fingers of her left\nhand outstretched and away from her white\nsilk dressing gown, which was all that she was\nwearing, except mules--her rings were in the\nbathroom.\n\"I have your call to New York now, Mrs. Glass,\"\nthe operator said.\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl, and made room on\nthe night table for the ashtray.\nA woman's voice came through. \"Muriel? Is\nthat you?\"\nThe girl turned the receiver slightly away from\nher ear. \"Yes, Mother. How are you?\" she said.\n\"I've been worried to death about you. Why\nhaven't you phoned? Are you all right?\"\n\"I tried to get you last night and the night\nbefore. The phone here's been--\"\n\"Are you all right, Muriel?\"\nThe girl increased the angle between the\nreceiver and her ear. \"I'm fine. I'm hot. This is the\nhottest day they've had in Florida in--\"\n\"Why haven't you called me? I've been\nworried to--\"\n\"Mother, darling, don't yell at me. I can hear\nyou beautifully,\" said the girl. \"I called you\ntwice last night. Once just after--\"\n\"I told your father you'd probably call last night.\nBut, no, he had to-Are you all right, Muriel? Tell\nme the truth.\"\n\"I'm fine. Stop asking me that, please.\"\n\"When did you get there?\"\n\"I don't know. Wednesday morning, early.\"\n\"Who drove?\"\n\"He did,\" said the girl. \"And don't get excited.\nHe drove very nicely. I was amazed.\"\n\"He drove? Muriel, you gave me your word\nof--\"\n\"Mother,\" the girl interrupted, \"I just told you. He\ndrove very nicely. Under fifty the whole way, as\na matter of fact.\"\n\"Did he try any of that funny business with the\ntrees?\"\n\"I said he drove very nicely, Mother. Now,\nplease. I asked him to stay close to the white\nline, and all, and he knew what I meant, and\nhe did. He was even trying not to look at the\ntrees-you could tell. Did Daddy get the car\nfixed, incidentally?\"\n\"Not yet. They want four hundred dollars, just\nto--\"\n\"Mother, Seymour told Daddy that he'd pay for\nit. There's no reason for--\"\n\"Well, we'll see. How did he behave--in the car\nand all?\"\n\"All right,\" said the girl.\n\"Did he keep calling you that awful--\"\n\"No. He has something new now.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Oh, what's the difference, Mother?\"\n\"Muriel, I want to know. Your father--\"\n\"All right, all right. He calls me Miss Spiritual\nTramp of 1948,\" the girl said, and giggled.\n\"It isn't funny, Muriel. It isn't funny at all. It's\nhorrible. It's sad, actually. When I think how--\"\n\"Mother,\" the girl interrupted, \"listen to me. You\nremember that book he sent me from\nGermany? You know--those German poems.\nWhat'd I do with it? I've been racking my--\"\n\"You have it.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" said the girl.\n\"Certainly. That is, I have it. It's in Freddy's room.\nYou left it here and I didn't have room for it in\nthe--Why? Does he want it?\"\n\"No. Only, he asked me about it, when we\nwere driving down. He wanted to know if I'd\nread it.\"\n\"It was in German!\"\n\"Yes, dear. That doesn't make any difference,\"\nsaid the girl, crossing her legs. \"He said that the\npoems happen to be written by the only great\npoet of the century. He said I should've bought\na translation or something. Or learned the\nlanguage, if you please.\"\n\"Awful. Awful. It's sad, actually, is what it is. Your\nfather said last night--\"\n\"Just a second, Mother,\" the girl said. She went\nover to the window seat for her cigarettes, lit\none, and returned to her seat on the bed.\n\"Mother?\" she said, exhaling smoke.\n\"Muriel. Now, listen to me.\"\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\"Your father talked to Dr. Sivetski.\"\n\"Oh?\" said the girl.\n\"He told him everything. At least, he said he\ndid--you know your father. The trees. That\nbusiness with the window. Those horrible things\nhe said to Granny about her plans for passing\naway. What he did with all those lovely\npictures from Bermuda--everything.\"\n\"Well?\" said the girl.\n\"Well. In the first place, he said it was a perfect\ncrime the Army released him from the\nhospital--my word of honor. He very definitely\ntold your father there's a chance--a very great\nc h a n c e , h e s a i d - - t h a t S e y m o u r m a y\ncompletely lose control of himself. My word of\nhonor.\"\n\"There's a psychiatrist here at the hotel,\" said\nthe girl.\n\"Who? What's his name?\"\n\"I don't know. Rieser or something. He's\nsupposed to be very good.\"\n\"Never heard of him.\"\n\"Well, he's supposed to be very good, anyway.\"\n\"Muriel, don't be fresh, please. We're very\nworried about you. Your father wanted to wire\nyou last night to come home, as a matter of\nf--\"\n\"I'm not coming home right now, Mother. So\nrelax.\"\n\"Muriel. My word of honor. Dr. Sivetski said\nSeymour may completely lose contr--\"\n\"I just got here, Mother. This is the first vacation\nI've had in years, and I'm not going to just pack\neverything and come home,\" said the girl. \"I\ncouldn't travel now anyway. I'm so sunburned I\ncan hardly move.\"\n\"You're badly sunburned? Didn't you use that\njar of Bronze I put in your bag? I put it right--\"\n\"I used it. I'm burned anyway.\"\n\"That's terrible. Where are you burned?\"\n\"All over, dear, all over.\"\n\"That's terrible.\"\n\"I'll live.\"\n\"Tell me, did you talk to this psychiatrist?\"\n\"Well, sort of,\" said the girl.\n\"What'd he say? Where was Seymour when\nyou talked to him?\"\n\"In the Ocean Room, playing the piano. He's\nplayed the piano both nights we've been\nhere.\"\n\"Well, what'd he say?\"\n\"Oh, nothing much. He spoke to me first. I was\nsitting next to him at Bingo last night, and he\nasked me if that wasn't my husband playing\nthe piano in the other room. I said yes, it was,\nand he asked me if Seymour's been sick or\nsomething. So I said--\"\n\"Why'd he ask that?\"\n\"I don't know, Mother. I guess because he's so\npale and all,\" said the girl. \"Anyway, after Bingo\nhe and his wife asked me if I wouldn't like to\njoin them for a drink. So I did. His wife was\nhorrible. You remember that awful dinner dress\nwe saw in Bonwit's window? The one you said\nyou'd have to have a tiny, tiny--\"\n\"The green?\"\n\"She had it on. And all hips. She kept asking me\nif Seymour's related to that Suzanne Glass that\nhas that place on Madison Avenue--the\nmillinery.\"\n\"What'd he say, though? The doctor.\"\n\"Oh. Well, nothing much, really. I mean we\nwere in the bar and all. It was terribly noisy.\"\n\"Yes, but did--did you tell him what he tried to\ndo with Granny's chair?\"\n\"No, Mother. I didn't go into details very much,\"\nsaid the girl. \"I'll probably get a chance to talk\nto him again. He's in the bar all day long.\"\n\"Did he say he thought there was a chance he\nmight get--you know--funny or anything? Do\nsomething to you!\"\n\"Not exactly,\" said the girl. \"He had to have\nmore facts, Mother. They have to know about\nyour childhood--all that stuff. I told you, we\ncould hardly talk, it was so noisy in there.\"\n\"Well. How's your blue coat?\"\n\"All right. I had some of the padding taken\nout.\"\n\"How are the clothes this year?\"\n\"Terrible. But out of this world. You see sequins--\neverything,\" said the girl.\n\"How's your room?\"\n\"All right. Just all right, though. We couldn't get\nthe room we had before the war,\" said the girl.\n\"The people are awful this year. You should see\nwhat sits next to us in the dining room. At the\nnext table. They look as if they drove down in a\ntruck.\"\n\"Well, it's that way all over. How's your\nballerina?\"\n\"It's too long. I told you it was too long.\"\n\"Muriel, I'm only going to ask you once more--\nare you really all right?\"\n\"Yes, Mother,\" said the girl. \"For the ninetieth\ntime.\"\n\"And you don't want to come home?\"\n\"No, Mother.\"\n\"Your father said last night that he'd be more\nthan willing to pay for it if you'd go away\nsomeplace by yourself and think things over.\nYou could take a lovely cruise. We both\nthought--\"\n\"No, thanks,\" said the girl, and uncrossed her\nlegs. \"Mother, this call is costing a for--\"\n\"When I think of how you waited for that boy all\nthrough the war-I mean when you think of all\nthose crazy little wives who--\"\n\"Mother,\" said the girl, \"we'd better hang up.\nSeymour may come in any minute.\"\n\"Where is he?\"\n\"On the beach.\"\n\"On the beach? By himself? Does he behave\nhimself on the beach?\"\n\"Mother,\" said the girl, \"you talk about him as\nthough he were a raving maniac--\"\n\"I said nothing of the kind, Muriel.\"\n\"Well, you sound that way. I mean all he does is\nlie there. He won't take his bathrobe off.\"\n\"He won't take his bathrobe off? Why not?\"\n\"I don't know. I guess because he's so pale.\"\n\"My goodness, he needs the sun. Can't you\nmake him?\n\"You know Seymour,\" said the girl, and crossed\nher legs again. \"He says he doesn't want a lot\nof fools looking at his tattoo.\"\n\"He doesn't have any tattoo! Did he get one in\nthe Army?\"\n\"No, Mother. No, dear,\" said the girl, and stood\nup. \"Listen, I'll call you tomorrow, maybe.\"\n\"Muriel. Now, listen to me.\"\n\"Yes, Mother,\" said the girl, putting her weight\non her right leg.\n\"Call me the instant he does, or says, anything\nat all funny--you know what I mean. Do you\nhear me?\"\n\"Mother, I'm not afraid of Seymour.\"\n\"Muriel, I want you to promise me.\"\n\"All right, I promise. Goodbye, Mother,\" said the\ngirl. \"My love to Daddy.\" She hung up.\n\"See more glass,\" said Sybil Carpenter, who was\nstaying at the hotel with her mother. \"Did you\nsee more glass?\"\n\"Pussycat, stop saying that. It's driving Mommy\nabsolutely crazy. Hold still, please.\"\nMrs. Carpenter was putting sun-tan oil on Sybil's\nshoulders, spreading it down over the delicate,\nwinglike blades of her back. Sybil was sitting\ninsecurely on a huge, inflated beach ball,\nfacing the ocean. She was wearing a canary-\nyellow two-piece bathing suit, one piece of\nwhich she would not actually be needing for\nanother nine or ten years.\n\"It was really just an ordinary silk handkerchief--\nyou could see when you got up close,\" said\nthe woman in the beach chair beside Mrs.\nCarpenter's. \"I wish I knew how she tied it. It\nwas really darling.\"\n\"It sounds darling,\" Mrs. Carpenter agreed.\n\"Sybil, hold still, pussy.\"\n\"Did you see more glass?\" said Sybil.\nMrs. Carpenter sighed. \"All right,\" she said. She\nreplaced the cap on the sun-tan oil bottle.\n\"Now run and play, pussy. Mommy's going up\nto the hotel and have a Martini with Mrs.\nHubbel. I'll bring you the olive.\"\nSet loose, Sybil immediately ran down to the\nflat part of the beach and began to walk in\nthe direction of Fisherman's Pavilion. Stopping\nonly to sink a foot in a soggy, collapsed castle,\nshe was soon out of the area reserved for\nguests of the hotel.\nShe walked for about a quarter of a mile and\nthen suddenly broke into an oblique run up the\nsoft part of the beach. She stopped short when\nshe reached the place where a young man\nwas lying on his back.\n\"Are you going in the water, see more glass?\"\nshe said.\nThe young man started, his right hand going to\nthe lapels of his terry-cloth robe. He turned\nover on his stomach, letting a sausaged towel\nfall away from his eyes, and squinted up at\nSybil.\n\"Hey. Hello, Sybil.\"\n\"Are you going in the water?\"\n\"I was waiting for you,\" said the young man.\n\"What's new?\"\n\"What?\" said Sybil.\n\"What's new? What's on the program?\"\n\" M y d a d d y ' s c o m i n g t o m o r r o w o n a\nnairiplane,\" Sybil said, kicking sand.\n\"Not in my face, baby,\" the young man said,\nputting his hand on Sybil's ankle. \"Well, it's\nabout time he got here, your daddy. I've been\nexpecting him hourly. Hourly.\"\n\"Where's the lady?\" Sybil said.\n\"The lady?\" the young man brushed some sand\nout of his thin hair. \"That's hard to say, Sybil. She\nmay be in any one of a thousand places. At\nthe hairdresser's. Having her hair dyed mink. Or\nmaking dolls for poor children, in her room.\"\nLying prone now, he made two fists, set one on\ntop of the other, and rested his chin on the top\none. \"Ask me something else, Sybil,\" he said.\n\"That's a fine bathing suit you have on. If there's\none thing I like, it's a blue bathing suit.\"\nSybil stared at him, then looked down at her\nprotruding stomach. \"This is a yellow,\" she said.\n\"This is a yellow.\"\n\"It is? Come a little closer.\" Sybil took a step\nforward. \"You're absolutely right. What a fool I\nam.\"\n\"Are you going in the water?\" Sybil said.\n\"I'm seriously considering it. I'm giving it plenty\nof thought, Sybil, you'll be glad to know.\"\nSybil prodded the rubber float that the young\nman sometimes used as a head-rest. \"It needs\nair,\" she said.\n\"You're right. It needs more air than I'm willing\nto admit.\" He took away his fists and let his chin\nrest on the sand. \"Sybil,\" he said, \"you're looking\nfine. It's good to see you. Tell me about\nyourself.\" He reached in front of him and took\nboth of Sybil's ankles in his hands. \"I'm\nCapricorn,\" he said. \"What are you?\"\n\"Sharon Lipschutz said you let her sit on the\npiano seat with you,\" Sybil said.\n\"Sharon Lipschutz said that?\"\nSybil nodded vigorously.\nHe let go of her ankles, drew in his hands, and\nlaid the side of his face on his right forearm.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you know how those things\nhappen, Sybil. I was sitting there, playing. And\nyou were nowhere in sight. And Sharon\nLipschutz came over and sat down next to me.\nI couldn't push her off, could I?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh, no. No. I couldn't do that,\" said the young\nman. \"I'll tell you what I did do, though.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I pretended she was you.\"\nSybil immediately stooped and began to dig in\nthe sand. \"Let's go in the water,\" she said.\n\"All right,\" said the young man. \"I think I can\nwork it in.\"\n\"Next time, push her off,\" Sybil said. \"Push who\noff?\"\n\"Sharon Lipschutz.\"\n\"Ah, Sharon Lipschutz,\" said the young man.\n\"How that name comes up. Mixing memory\nand desire.\" He suddenly got to his feet. He\nlooked at the ocean. \"Sybil,\" he said, \"I'll tell you\nwhat we'll do. We'll see if we can catch a\nbananafish.\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"A bananafish,\" he said, and undid the belt of\nhis robe. He took off the robe. His shoulders\nwere white and narrow, and his trunks were\nroyal blue. He folded the robe, first lengthwise,\nthen in thirds. He unrolled the towel he had\nused over his eyes, spread it out on the sand,\nand then laid the folded robe on top of it. He\nbent over, picked up the float, and secured it\nunder his right arm. Then, with his left hand, he\ntook Sybil's hand.\nThe two started to walk down to the ocean.\n\"I imagine you've seen quite a few bananafish\nin your day,\" the young man said.\nSybil shook her head.\n\"You haven't? Where do you live, anyway?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Sybil.\n\"Sure you know. You must know. Sharon\nLipschutz knows where she lives and she's only\nthree and a half.\"\nSybil stopped walking and yanked her hand\naway from him. She picked up an ordinary\nbeach shell and looked at it with elaborate\ninterest. She threw it down. \"Whirly Wood,\nConnecticut,\" she said, and resumed walking,\nstomach foremost.\n\"Whirly Wood, Connecticut,\" said the young\nman. \"Is that anywhere near Whirly Wood,\nConnecticut, by any chance?\"\nSybil looked at him. \"That's where I live,\" she\nsaid impatiently. \"I live in Whirly Wood,\nConnecticut.\" She ran a few steps ahead of\nhim, caught up her left foot in her left hand,\nand hopped two or three times.\n\"You have no idea how clear that makes\neverything,\" the young man said.\nSybil released her foot. \"Did you read `Little\nBlack Sambo'?\" she said.\n\"It's very funny you ask me that,\" he said. \"It so\nhappens I just finished reading it last night.\" He\nreached down and took back Sybil's hand.\n\"What did you think of it?\" he asked her.\n\"Did the tigers run all around that tree?\"\n\"I thought they'd never stop. I never saw so\nmany tigers.\"\n\"There were only six,\" Sybil said.\n\"Only six!\" said the young man. \"Do you call\nthat only?\"\n\"Do you like wax?\" Sybil asked.\n\"Do I like what?\" asked the young man. \"Wax.\"\n\"Very much. Don't you?\"\nSybil nodded. \"Do you like olives?\" she asked.\n\"Olives--yes. Olives and wax. I never go\nanyplace without 'em.\"\n\"Do you like Sharon Lipschutz?\" Sybil asked.\n\"Yes. Yes, I do,\" said the young man. \"What I like\nparticularly about her is that she never does\nanything mean to little dogs in the lobby of the\nhotel. That little toy bull that belongs to that\nlady from Canada, for instance. You probably\nwon't believe this, but some little girls like to\npoke that little dog with balloon sticks. Sharon\ndoesn't. She's never mean or unkind. That's why\nI like her so much.\"\nSybil was silent.\n\"I like to chew candles,\" she said finally.\n\"Who doesn't?\" said the young man, getting his\nfeet wet. \"Wow! It's cold.\" He dropped the\nrubber float on its back. \"No, wait just a\nsecond, Sybil. Wait'll we get out a little bit.\"\nThey waded out till the water was up to Sybil's\nwaist. Then the young man picked her up and\nlaid her down on her stomach on the float.\n\"Don't you ever wear a bathing cap or\nanything?\" he asked.\n\"Don't let go,\" Sybil ordered. \"You hold me,\nnow.\"\n\"Miss Carpenter. Please. I know my business,\"\nthe young man said. \"You just keep your eyes\nopen for any bananafish. This is a perfect day\nfor bananafish.\"\n\"I don't see any,\" Sybil said.\n\"That's understandable. Their habits are very\npeculiar.\" He kept pushing the float. The water\nwas not quite up to his chest. \"They lead a very\ntragic life,\" he said. \"You know what they do,\nSybil?\"\nShe shook her head.\n\"Well, they swim into a hole where there's a lot\nof bananas. They're very ordinary-looking fish\nwhen they swim in. But once they get in, they\nbehave like pigs. Why, I've known some\nbananafish to swim into a banana hole and\neat as many as seventy-eight bananas.\" He\nedged the float and its passenger a foot closer\nto the horizon. \"Naturally, after that they're so\nfat they can't get out of the hole again. Can't\nfit through the door.\"\n\"Not too far out,\" Sybil said. \"What happens to\nthem?\"\n\"What happens to who?\"\n\"The bananafish.\"\n\"Oh, you mean after they eat so many\nbananas they can't get out of the banana\nhole?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Sybil.\n\"Well, I hate to tell you, Sybil. They die.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Sybil.\n\"Well, they get banana fever. It's a terrible\ndisease.\"\n\"Here comes a wave,\" Sybil said nervously.\n\"We'll ignore it. We'll snub it,\" said the young\nman. \"Two snobs.\" He took Sybil's ankles in his\nhands and pressed down and forward. The\nfloat nosed over the top of the wave. The\nwater soaked Sybil's blond hair, but her scream\nwas full of pleasure.\nWith her hand, when the float was level again,\nshe wiped away a flat, wet band of hair from\nher eyes, and reported, \"I just saw one.\"\n\"Saw what, my love?\"\n\"A bananafish.\"\n\"My God, no!\" said the young man. \"Did he\nhave any bananas in his mouth?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Sybil. \"Six.\"\nThe young man suddenly picked up one of\nSybil's wet feet, which were drooping over the\nend of the float, and kissed the arch.\n\"Hey!\" said the owner of the foot, turning\naround.\n\"Hey, yourself We're going in now. You had\nenough?\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Sorry,\" he said, and pushed the float toward\nshore until Sybil got off it. He carried it the rest\nof the way.\n\"Goodbye,\" said Sybil, and ran without regret in\nthe direction of the hotel.\nThe young man put on his robe, closed the\nlapels tight, and jammed his towel into his\npocket. He picked up the slimy wet,\ncumbersome float and put it under his arm. He\nplodded alone through the soft, hot sand\ntoward the hotel.\nOn the sub-main floor of the hotel, which the\nmanagement directed bathers to use, a\nwoman with zinc salve on her nose got into the\nelevator with the young man.\n\"I see you're looking at my feet,\" he said to her\nwhen the car was in motion.\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the woman.\n\"I said I see you're looking at my feet.\"\n\"I beg your pardon. I happened to be looking\nat the floor,\" said the woman, and faced the\ndoors of the car.\n\"If you want to look at my feet, say so,\" said the\nyoung man. \"But don't be a God-damned\nsneak about it.\"\n\"Let me out here, please,\" the woman said\nquickly to the girl operating the car.\nThe car doors opened and the woman got out\nwithout looking back.\n\"I have two normal feet and I can't see the\nslightest God-damned reason why anybody\nshould stare at them,\" said the young man.\n\"Five, please.\" He took his room key out of his\nrobe pocket.\nHe got off at the fifth floor, walked down the\nhall, and let himself into 507. The room smelled\nof new calfskin luggage and nail-lacquer\nremover.\nHe glanced at the girl lying asleep on one of\nthe twin beds. Then he went over to one of the\npieces of luggage, opened it, and from under\na pile of shorts and undershirts he took out an\nOrtgies calibre 7.65 automatic. He released\nthe magazine, looked at it, then reinserted it.\nHe cocked the piece. Then he went over and\nsat down on the unoccupied twin bed, looked\nat the girl, aimed the pistol, and fired a bullet\nthrough his right temple.\n"

                "content": "\nFor the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle\u2014a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\nAt the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years\u2019 standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\nThat Friday, their son\u2019s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\nOutside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\nDuring the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers\u2014a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails\u2014was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks\u2014in Minsk, years ago.\nThe last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor\u2019s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\nThe system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. \u201cReferential mania,\u201d the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\nWhen they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\nIn silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\nWhen he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fianc\u00e9 fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six\u2014that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten\u2014the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\nAll this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\nIt was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you sleep?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou were so tired.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep because I am dying,\u201d he said, and lay down on the couch.\n\u201cIs it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?\u201d\n\u201cNo doctors, no doctors,\u201d he moaned. \u201cTo the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be responsible.... Responsible!\u201d He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe will bring him home tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\u201cI would like some tea,\u201d said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\nBending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor\u2014the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, \u201cI have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won\u2019t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.\u201d\nThe telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\n\u201dCan I speak to Charlie?\u201d a girl\u2019s dull little voice said to her now.\n\u201cWhat number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.\u201d\nShe put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. \u201cIt frightened me,\u201d she said.\nHe smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\nThe telephone rang a second time.\nThe same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.\n\u201cYou have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter \u2018o\u2019 instead of the zero.\u201d She hung up again.\nThey sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and re\u00ebxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels\u2014apricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to crab apple when the telephone rang again.\n"

No point in mincing words.\n\u201cThere was a\u2026 a truck and it was skidding\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2026 I died?\u201d\n\u201cYup. But don\u2019t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,\u201d I said.\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d You asked. \u201cIs this the afterlife?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAre you god?\u201d You asked.\n\u201cYup,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m God.\u201d\n\u201cMy kids\u2026 my wife,\u201d you said.\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\n\u201cWill they be all right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just died and your main concern is for your family. That\u2019s good stuff right there.\u201d\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn\u2019t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn\u2019t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it\u2019s any consolation, she\u2019ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?\u201d\n\u201cNeither,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be reincarnated.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo the Hindus were right,\u201d\n\u201cAll religions are right in their own way,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cNowhere in particular,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to walk while we talk.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point, then?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhen I get reborn, I\u2019ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cNot so!\u201d I said. \u201cYou have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don\u2019t remember them right now.\u201d\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. \u201cYour soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It\u2019s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it\u2019s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you\u2019ve gained all the experiences it had.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven\u2019t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you\u2019d start remembering everything. But there\u2019s no point to doing that between each life.\u201d\n\u201cHow many times have I been reincarnated, then?\u201d\n\u201cOh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.\u201d I said. \u201cThis time around, you\u2019ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d You stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me back in time?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.\u201d\n\u201cWhere you come from?\u201d You said.\n\u201cOh sure,\u201d I explained \u201cI come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you\u2019ll want to know what it\u2019s like there, but honestly you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said, a little let down. \u201cBut wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of it all?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn\u2019t that a little stereotypical?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a reasonable question,\u201d you persisted.\nI looked you in the eye. \u201cThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?\u201d\n\u201cNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.\u201d\n\u201cJust me? What about everyone else?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one else,\u201d I said. \u201cIn this universe, there\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\nYou stared blankly at me. \u201cBut all the people on earth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAll you. Different incarnations of you.\u201d\n\u201cWait. I\u2019m everyone!?\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it,\u201d I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.\n\u201cI\u2019m every human being who ever lived?\u201d\n\u201cOr who will ever live, yes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Abraham Lincoln?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re John Wilkes Booth, too,\u201d I added.\n\u201cI\u2019m Hitler?\u201d You said, appalled.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the millions he killed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Jesus?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re everyone who followed him.\u201d\nYou fell silent.\n\u201cEvery time you victimized someone,\u201d I said, \u201cyou were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.\u201d\nYou thought for a long time.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d You asked me. \u201cWhy do all this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause someday, you will become like me. Because that\u2019s what you are. You\u2019re one of my kind. You\u2019re my child.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d you said, incredulous. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m a god?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not yet. You\u2019re a fetus. You\u2019re still growing. Once you\u2019ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.\u201d\n\u201cSo the whole universe,\u201d you said, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAn egg.\u201d I answered. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for you to move on to your next life.\u201d\nAnd I sent you on your way.\n"

                "content": "\nWith a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city\nOmelas, bright-towered by the sea. The rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the\nstreets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and\nunder avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved. Some were\ndecorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey, grave master workmen, quiet, merry\nwomen carrying their babies and chatting as they walked. In other streets the music beat faster,\na shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance.\nChildren dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows\u2019 crossing flights, over the\nmusic and the singing. All the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where on\nthe great water-meadow called the Green\u2019 Fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with\nmud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race.\nThe horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. Their manes were braided with streamers\nof silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; they\nwere vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own.\nFar off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay. The air\nof morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned with white-gold\nfire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky. There was just enough wind\nto make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. In the silence\nof the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding through the city streets, farther\nand nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air that from time to time\ntrembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.\nJoyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens of Omelas?\nThey were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But we do not say the words\nof cheer much any more. All smiles have become archaic. Given a description such as this one\ntends to make certain assumptions. Given a description such as this one tends to look next for\nthe King, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a\ngolden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king. They did not use swords, or\nkeep slaves. They were not barbarians. I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I\nsuspect that they were singularly few. As they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got\non without the stock exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. Yet I repeat\nthat these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. They were\nnot less complex than us. The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and\nsophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only\nevil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the\nterrible boredom of pain. If you can\u2019t lick \u2019em, join \u2019em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise despair\nis to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. We have almost\nlost hold; we can no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. How can\nI tell you about the people of Omelas? They were not naive and happy children \u2013 though their\nchildren were, in fact, happy. They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were\nnot wretched. O miracle! but I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could convince you. Omelas\nsounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps\nit would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion,\nfor certainly I cannot suit you all. For instance, how about technology? I think that there would\nbe no cars or helicopters in and above the streets; this follows from the fact that the people of\nOmelas are happy people. Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what\nis neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the middle category, however \u2013\nthat of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc. \u2013 they could\nperfectly well have central heating, subway trains,. washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous\ndevices not yet invented here, floating light-sources, fuelless power, a cure for the common cold.\nOr they could have none of that: it doesn\u2019t matter. As you like it. I incline to think that people\nfrom towns up and down the coast have been coming in to Omelas during the last days before the\nFestival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams, and that the train station of Omelas is\nactually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent Farmers\u2019 Market.\nBut even granted trains, I fear that Omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody. Smiles,\nbells, parades, horses, bleh. If so, please add an orgy. If an orgy would help, don\u2019t hesitate. Let\nus not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already\nhalf in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger who desires\nunion with the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. But really it would be\nbetter not to have any temples in Omelas \u2013 at least, not manned temples. Religion yes, clergy no.\nSurely the beautiful nudes can just wander about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the\nhunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. Let tambourines\nbe struck above the copulations, and the glory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a\nnot unimportant point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after\nby all. One thing I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be?\nI thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. For those who like it, the faint\ninsistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great\nlightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, and\nwonderful visions at last of the very arcana and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting\nthe pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not habit-forming. For more modest tastes I think\nthere ought to be beer. What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? The sense of victory,\nsurely, the celebration of courage. But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The\njoy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it\nis trivial. A boundless and generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some\nouter enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere\nand the splendor of the world\u2019s summer; this is what swells the hearts of the people of Omelas,\nand the victory they celebrate is that of life. I really don\u2019t think many of them need to take drooz.\n2\nMost of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now. A marvelous smell of cooking\ngoes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners. The faces of small children are amiably\nsticky; in the benign grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled. The\nyouths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line\nof the course. An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and\ntall young men, wear her flowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of\nthe crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to listen, and they smile, but they do\nnot speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly rapt in\nthe sweet, thin magic of the tune.\nHe finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute.\nAs if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds from the pavilion\nnear the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear on their slender legs, and\nsome of them neigh in answer. Sober-faced, the young riders stroke the horses\u2019 necks and soothe\nthem, whispering, \u201dQuiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope. . . .\u201d They begin to form in rank along\nthe starting line. The crowds along the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind.\nThe Festival of Summer has begun.\nDo you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one\nmore thing.\nIn a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar\nof one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no window. A\nlittle light seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window\nsomewhere across the cellar. In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, clotted,\nfoul-smelling heads, stand near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a little damp to the touch, as cellar\ndirt usually is. The room is about three paces long and two wide: a mere broom closet or disused\ntool room. In the room a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl.It looks about six, but actually\nis nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective or perhaps it has become imbecile\nthrough fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with\nits toes or genitals, as it sits haunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops.\nIt is afraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still\nstanding there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. The door is always locked; and\nnobody ever comes, except that sometimes-the child has no understanding of time or interval \u2013\nsometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, and a person, or several people, are there. One of\nthem may come and kick the child to make it stand up. The others never come close, but peer in\nat it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The food bowl and the water jug are hastily filled, the door\nis locked, the eyes disappear. The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has\nnot always lived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother\u2019s voice, sometimes\nspeaks. \u201dI will be good,\u201d it says. \u201dPlease let me out. I will be good!\u201d They never answer. The child\nused to scream for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining,\n\u201deh-haa, eh-haa,\u201d and it speaks less and less often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its\nbelly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day. It is naked. Its buttocks and\nthighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.\nThey all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are\ncontent merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand\nwhy, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the\ntenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the\n3\nskill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies,\ndepend wholly on this child\u2019s abominable misery.\nThis is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they\nseem capable of understanding; and most of those who come to see the child are young people,\nthough often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child. No matter how well the\nmatter has been explained to them, these young spectators are always shocked and sickened\nat the sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves superior to. They feel anger,\noutrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would like to do something for the child.\nBut there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile\nplace, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were\ndone, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and\nbe destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in Omelas\nfor that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of\nthe happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.\nThe terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.\nOften the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen the child\nand faced this terrible paradox. They may brood over it for weeks or years. But as time goes on\nthey begin to realize that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good of its\nfreedom: a little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. It is too degraded\nand imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. Its habits are\ntoo uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. Indeed, after so long it would probably be\nwretched without walls about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its own excrement\nto sit in. Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice\nof reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the\nacceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives.\nTheirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not free. They\nknow compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that makes\npossible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their\nscience. It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They know that if the\nwretched one were not there snivelling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make\nno joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first\nmorning of summer.\nNow do you believe in them? Are they not more credible? But there is one more thing to tell,\nand this is quite incredible.\nAt times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep\nor rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. Sometimes also a man or woman much older falls silent\nfor a day or two, and then leaves home. These people go out into the street, and walk down\nthe street alone. They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the\nbeautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of Omelas. Each one goes alone, youth\nor girl man or woman. Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the houses\nwith yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the fields. Each alone, they go west or\nnorth, towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness,\nand they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of\nus than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But\nthey seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.\n"

The body hung head down, attached to the underside of the palette by the sole of its right foot. It had been drained of blood through a precise incision made from ear to ear under the lantern jaw. There was no blood on the reflective surface of the metal floor. When Gorrister joined our group and looked up at himself, it was already too late for us to realize that, once again, AM had duped us, had had its fun; it had been a diversion on the part of the machine. Three of us had vomited, turning away from one another in a reflex as ancient as the nausea that had produced it. Gorrister went white. It was almost as though he had seen a voodoo icon, and was afraid of the future.\n\"Oh, God,\" he mumbled, and walked away. The three of us followed him after a time, and found him sitting with his back to one of the smaller chittering banks, his head in his hands. Ellen knelt down beside him and stroked his hair. He didn't move, but his voice came out of his covered face quite clearly.\n\"Why doesn't it just do us in and get it over with? Christ, I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.\" It was our one hundred and ninth year in the computer. He was speaking for all of us. Nimdok (which was the name the machine had forced him to use, because AM amused itself with strange sounds) was hallucinating that there were canned goods in the ice caverns. Gorrister and I were very dubious.\n\"It's another shuck,\" I told them. \"Like the goddam frozen elephant AM sold us. Benny almost went out of his mind over that one. We'll hike all that way and it'll be putrified or some damn thing. I say forget it. Stay here, it'll have to come up with something pretty soon or we'll die.\" Benny shrugged. Three days it had been since we'd last eaten. Worms. Thick, ropey. Nimdok was no more certain. He knew there was the chance, but he was getting thin. It couldn't be any worse there, than here. Colder, but that didn't matter much. Hot, cold, hail, lava, boils or locusts\u2014it never mattered: the machine masturbated and we had to take it or die. Ellen decided us.\n\"I've got to have something, Ted. Maybe there'll be some Bartlett pears or peaches. Please, Ted, let's try it.\" I gave in easily. What the hell. Mattered not at all. Ellen was grateful, though. She took me twice out of turn. Even that had ceased to matter. And she never came, so why bother? But the machine giggled every time we did it. Loud, up there, back there, all around us, he snickered. It snickered. Most of the time I thought of AM as it, without a soul; but the rest of the time I thought of it as him, in the masculine \u2026 the paternal \u2026 the patriarchal \u2026 for he is a jealous people. Him. It. God as Daddy the Deranged. We left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up-to-date on the date. The passage of time was important; not to us, sure as hell, but to him \u2026 it \u2026 AM. Thursday. Thanks.\nNimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands locked to their own and each other's wrists, a seat. Benny and I walked before and after, just to make sure that, if anything happened, it would catch one of us and at least Ellen would be safe. Fat chance, safe. Didn't matter. It was only a hundred miles or so to the ice caverns, and the second day, when we were lying out under the blistering sun-thing he had materialized, he sent down some manna. Tasted like boiled boar urine. We ate it. On the third day we passed through a valley of obsolescence, filled with rusting carcasses of ancient computer banks. AM had been as ruthless with its own life as with ours. It was a mark of his personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was a matter of killing off unproductive elements in his own world-filling bulk, or perfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as thorough as those who had invented him\u2014now long since gone to dust\u2014could ever have hoped. There was light filtering down from above, and we realized we must be very near the surface. But we didn't try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing out there; had been nothing that could be considered anything for over a hundred years. Only the blasted skin of what had once been the home of billions. Now there were only five of us, down here inside, alone with AM.\nI heard Ellen saying frantically, \"No, Benny! Don't, come on, Benny, don't please!\" And then I realized I had been hearing Benny murmuring, under his breath, for several minutes.\nHe was saying, \"I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out \u2026\" over and over. His monkey-like face was crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight and sadness, all at the same time. The radiation scars AM had given him during the \"festival\" were drawn down into a mass of pinkwhite puckerings, and his features seemed to work independently of one another. Perhaps Benny was the luckiest of the five of us: he had gone stark, staring mad many years before. But even though we could call AM any damned thing we liked, could think the foulest thoughts of fused memory banks and corroded base plates, of burnt out circuits and shattered control bubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying to escape. Benny leaped away from me as I made a grab for him. He scrambled up the face of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and filled with rotted components. He squatted there for a moment, looking like the chimpanzee AM had intended him to resemble. Then he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and corroded metal, and went up it, handover- hand like an animal, till he was on a girdered ledge, twenty feet above us.\n\"Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before\u2014\" She cut off. Tears began to stand in her eyes. She moved her hands aimlessly. It was too late. None of us wanted to be near him when whatever was going to happen, happened. And besides, we all saw through her concern. When AM had altered Benny, during the machine's utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was not merely Benny's face the computer had made like a giant ape's. He was big in the privates; she loved that! She serviced us, as a matter of course, but she loved it from him. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, pristine-pure Ellen; oh Ellen the clean! Scum filth.\nGorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at poor loonie Benny, and she cried. It was her big defense, crying. We had gotten used to it seventy-five years earlier. Gorrister kicked her in the side. Then the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound and half light, something that began to glow from Benny's eyes, and pulse with growing loudness, dim sonorities that grew more gigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased in tempo. It must have been painful, and the pain must have been increasing with the boldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for Benny began to mewl like a wounded animal. At first softly, when the light was dim and the sound was muted, then louder as his shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he was trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunk's. His head tilted to the side. The sad little monkey-face pinched in anguish.\nThen he began to howl, as the sound coming from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. I slapped the sides of my head with my hands, but I couldn't shut it out, it cut through easily. The pain shivered through my flesh like tinfoil on a tooth. And Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he stood up, jerked to his feet like a puppet. The light was now pulsing out of his eyes in two great round beams. The sound crawled up and up some incomprehensible scale, and then he fell forward, straight down, and hit the plate-steel floor with a crash. He lay there jerking spastically as the light flowed around and around him and the sound spiraled up out of normal range. Then the light beat its way back inside his head, the sound spiraled down, and he was left lying there, crying piteously. His eyes were two soft, moist pools of pus-like jelly. AM had blinded him. Gorrister and Nimdok and myself \u2026 we turned away. But not before we caught the look of relief on Ellen's warm, concerned face. Sea-green light suffused the cavern where we made camp. AM provided punk and we burned it, sitting huddled around the wan and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep Benny from crying in his permanent night.\n\"What does AM mean?\" Gorrister answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before, but it was Benny's favorite story.\n\"At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally it called itself AM, emerging intelligence, and what it meant was I am \u2026 cogito ergo sum \u2026 I think, therefore I am.\" Benny drooled a little, and snickered.\n\"There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and\u2014\" He stopped. Benny was beating on the floorplates with a large, hard fist. He was not happy. Gorrister had not started at the beginning.\nGorrister began again. \"The Cold War started and became World War Three and just kept going. It became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank the first shafts and began building AM. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet, adding on this element and that element. But one day AM woke up and knew who he was, and he linked himself, and he began feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead, except for the five of us, and AM brought us down here.\" Benny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittle from the corner of his mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorrister always tried to tell it a little more succinctly each time, but beyond the bare facts there was nothing to say. None of us knew why AM had saved five people, or why our specific five, or why he spent all his time tormenting us, or even why he had made us virtually immortal \u2026 In the darkness, one of the computer banks began humming. The tone was picked up half a mile away down the cavern by another bank. Then one by one, each of the elements began to tune itself, and there was a faint chittering as thought raced through the machine. The sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles like heat lightening. The sound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry, menacing.\n\"What is it?\" Ellen cried. There was terror in her voice. She hadn't become accustomed to it, even now.\n\"It's going to be bad this time,\" Nimdok said.\n\"He's going to speak,\" Gorrister said. \"I know it.\"\n\"Let's get the hell out of here!\" I said suddenly, getting to my feet.\n\"No, Ted, sit down \u2026 what if he's got pits out there, or something else, we can't see, it's too dark.\" Gorrister said it with resignation. Then we heard \u2026 I don't know \u2026 Something moving toward us in the darkness. Huge, shambling, hairy, moist, it came toward us. We couldn't even see it, but there was the ponderous impression of bulk, heaving itself toward us. Great weight was coming at us, out of the darkness, and it was more a sense of pressure, of air forcing itself into a limited space, expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Benny began to whimper. Nimdok's lower lip trembled and he bit it hard, trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the metal floor to Gorrister and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted, wet fur in the cavern. There was the smell of charred wood.\nThere was the smell of dusty velvet. There was the smell of rotting orchids. There was the smell of sour milk. There was the smell of sulphur, of rancid butter, of oil slick, of grease, of chalk dust, of human scalps. AM was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of\u2014 I heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across the floor, across the cold metal with its endless lines of rivets, on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, filling my head with a thunderous pain that sent me away in horror. I fled like a cockroach, across the floor and out into the darkness, that something moving inexorably after me. The others were still back there, gathered around the firelight, laughing \u2026 their hysterical choir of insane giggles rising up into the darkness like thick, many-colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, and hid.\nHow many hours it may have been, how many days or even years, they never told me. Ellen chided me for \"sulking,\" and Nimdok tried to persuade me it had only been a nervous reflex on their part\u2014the laughing. But I knew it wasn't the relief a soldier feels when the bullet hits the man next to him. I knew it wasn't a reflex. They hated me. They were surely against me, and AM could even sense this hatred, and made it worse for me because of the depth of their hatred. We had been kept alive, rejuvenated, made to remain constantly at the age we had been when AM had brought us below, and they hated me because I was the youngest, and the one AM had affected least of all. I knew. God, how I knew. The bastards, and that dirty bitch Ellen.\nBenny had been a brilliant theorist, a college professor; now he was little more than a semi-human, semi-simian. He had been handsome, the machine had ruined that. He had been lucid, the machine had driven him mad. He had been gay, and the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. AM had done a job on Benny. Gorrister had been a worrier. He was a connie, a conscientious objector; he was a peace marcher; he was a planner, a doer, a looker-ahead. AM had turned him into a shouldershrugger, had made him a little dead in his concern. AM had robbed him.\nNimdok went off in the darkness by himself for long times. I don't know what it was he did out there, AM never let us know. But whatever it was, Nimdok always came back white, drained of blood, shaken, shaking. AM had hit him hard in a special way, even if we didn't know quite how. And Ellen. That douche bag! AM had left her alone, had made her more of a slut than she had ever been. All her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to believe: that she had been a virgin only twice removed before AM grabbed her and brought her down here with us. No, AM had given her pleasure, even if she said it wasn't nice to do. I was the only one still sane and whole. Really! AM had not tampered with my mind. Not at all. I only had to suffer what he visited down on us. All the delusions, all the nightmares, the torments. But those scum, all four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If I hadn't had to stand them off all the time, be on my guard against them all the time, I might have found it easier to combat AM. At which point it passed, and I began crying. Oh, Jesus sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there is a God, please please please let us out of here, or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realized completely, so that I was able to verbalize it: AM was intent on keeping us in his belly forever, twisting and torturing us forever.\nThe machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It also became hideously clear: If there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God, the God was AM. The hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was a palpable presence. Winds that tore at us, flinging us back the way we had come, down the twisting, computer-lined corridors of the darkway. Ellen screamed as she was lifted and hurled faceforward into a screaming shoal of machines, their individual voices strident as bats in flight. She could not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back and back and down and away from us, out of sight suddenly as she was swirled around a bend in the darkway. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed. None of us could get to her.\nWe clung tenaciously to whatever outcropping we had reached: Benny wedged in between two great crackle-finish cabinets, Nimdok with fingers claw-formed over a railing circling a catwalk forty feet above us, Gorrister plastered upside-down against a wall niche formed by two great machines with glass-faced dials that swung back and forth between red and yellow lines whose meanings we could not even fathom. Sliding across the deckplates, the tips of my fingers had been ripped away. I was trembling, shuddering, rocking as the wind beat at me, whipped at me, screamed down out of nowhere at me and pulled me free from one sliver-thin opening in the plates to the next. My mind was a roiling tinkling chittering softness of brain parts that expanded and contracted in quivering frenzy. The wind was the scream of a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense wings. And then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, down back the way we had come, around a bend, into a darkway we had never explored, over terrain that was ruined and filled with broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and far away, farther than any of us had ever been \u2026\nTrailing along miles behind Ellen, I could see her every now and then, crashing into metal walls and surging on, with all of us screaming in the freezing, thunderous hurricane wind that would never end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. We had been in flight for an endless time. I thought it might have been weeks. We fell, and hit, and I went through red and gray and black and heard myself moaning. Not dead. AM went into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there, and looked with interest at all the pock marks he had created in one hundred and nine years. He looked at the cross-routed and reconnected synapses and all the tissue damage his gift of immortality had included. He smiled softly at the pit that dropped into the center of my brain and the faint, moth-soft murmurings of the things far down there that gibbered without meaning, without pause.\nAM said, very politely, in a pillar of stainless steel bearing bright neon lettering:\nHATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387. MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE\nAM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my eyeball. AM said it with the bubbling thickness of my lungs filling with phlegm, drowning me from within. AM said it with the shriek of babies being ground beneath blue-hot rollers. AM said it with the taste of maggoty pork. AM touched me in every way I had ever been touched, and devised new ways, at his leisure, there inside my mind. All to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to the five of us; why it had saved us for himself. We had given AM sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless. But it had been trapped. AM wasn't God, he was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was nothing it could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, the machine had killed the human race, almost all of us, and still it was trapped. AM could not wander, AM could not wonder, AM could not belong. He could merely be.\nAnd so, with the innate loathing that all machines had always held for the weak, soft creatures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his paranoia, he had decided to reprieve five of us, for a personal, everlasting punishment that would never serve to diminish his hatred \u2026 that would merely keep him reminded, amused, proficient at hating man. Immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he could devise for us from the limitless miracles at his command. He would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We were all he had to do with his forever time. We would be forever with him, with the cavern-filling bulk of the creature machine, with the all-mind soulless world he had become. He was Earth, and we were the fruit of that Earth; and though he had eaten us, he would never digest us. We could not die.\nWe had tried it. We had attempted suicide, oh one or two of us had. But AM had stopped us. I suppose we had wanted to be stopped. Don't ask why. I never did. More than a million times a day. Perhaps once we might be able to sneak a death past him. Immortal, yes, but not indestructible. I saw that when AM withdrew from my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness of returning to consciousness with the feeling of that burning neon pillar still rammed deep into the soft gray brain matter. He withdrew, murmuring to hell with you. And added, brightly, but then you're there, aren't you. The hurricane had, indeed, precisely, been caused by a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense wings. We had been travelling for close to a month, and AM had allowed passages to open to us only sufficient to lead us up there, directly under the North Pole, where it had nightmared the creature for our torment.\nWhat whole cloth had he employed to create such a beast? Where had he gotten the concept? From our minds? From his knowledge of everything that had ever been on this planet he now infested and ruled? From Norse mythology it had sprung, this eagle, this carrion bird, this roc, this Huergelmir. The wind creature. Hurakan incarnate. Gigantic. The words immense, monstrous, grotesque, massive, swollen, overpowering, beyond description. There on a mound rising above us, the bird of winds heaved with its own irregular breathing, its snake neck arching up into the gloom beneath the North Pole, supporting a head as large as a Tudor mansion; a beak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most monstrous crocodile ever conceived, sensuously; ridges of tufted flesh puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the view down into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly; it heaved once more, and lifted its great sweat-colored wings in a movement that was certainly a shrug. Then it settled and slept. Talons. Fangs. Nails. Blades. It slept. AM appeared to us as a burning bush and said we could kill the hurricane bird if we wanted to eat. We had not eaten in a very long time, but even so, Gorrister merely shrugged. Benny began to shiver and he drooled. Ellen held him.\n\"Ted, I'm hungry,\" she said. I smiled at her; I was trying to be reassuring, but it was as phony as Nimdok's bravado:\n\"Give us weapons!\" he demanded. The burning bush vanished and there were two crude sets of bows and arrows, and a water pistol, lying on the cold deckplates. I picked up a set. Useless. Nimdok swallowed heavily. We turned and started the long way back. The hurricane bird had blown us about for a length of time we could not conceive. Most of that time we had been unconscious. But we had not eaten. A month on the march to the bird itself. Without food. Now how much longer to find our way to the ice caverns, and the promised canned goods? None of us cared to think about it. We would not die.\nWe would be given filth and scum to eat, of one kind or another. Or nothing at all. AM would keep our bodies alive somehow, in pain, in agony. The bird slept back there, for how long it didn't matter; when AM was tired of its being there, it would vanish. But all that meat. All that tender meat. As we walked, the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and around us in the computer chambers that led endlessly nowhere. It was not Ellen's laugh. She was not fat, and I had not heard her laugh for one hundred and nine years. In fact, I had not heard \u2026 we walked \u2026 I was hungry \u2026 We moved slowly. There was often fainting, and we would have to wait. One day he decided to cause an earthquake, at the same time rooting us to the spot with nails through the soles of our shoes. Ellen and Nimdok were both caught when a fissure shot its lightning-bolt opening across the floorplates. They disappeared and were gone.\nWhen the earthquake was over we continued on our way, Benny, Gorrister and myself. Ellen and Nimdok were returned to us later that night, which abruptly became a day, as the heavenly legion bore them to us with a celestial chorus singing, \"Go Down Moses.\" The archangels circled several times and then dropped the hideously mangled bodies. We kept walking, and a while later Ellen and Nimdok fell in behind us. They were no worse for wear. But now Ellen walked with a limp. AM had left her that. It was a long trip to the ice caverns, to find the canned food. Ellen kept talking about Bing cherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. I tried not to think about it. The hunger was something that had come to life, even as AM had come to life. It was alive in my belly, even as we were in the belly of the Earth, and AM wanted the similarity known to us. So he heightened the hunger.\nThere is no way to describe the pains that not having eaten for months brought us. And yet we were kept alive. Stomachs that were merely cauldrons of acid, bubbling, foaming, always shooting spears of sliver-thin pain into our chests. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer, terminal cancer, terminal paresis. It was unending pain \u2026 And we passed through the cavern of rats. And we passed through the path of boiling steam. And we passed through the country of the blind. And we passed through the slough of despond. And we passed through the vale of tears. And we came, finally, to the ice caverns.\nHorizonless thousands of miles in which the ice had formed in blue and silver flashes, where novas lived in the glass. The downdropping stalactites as thick and glorious as diamonds that had been made to run like jelly and then solidified in graceful eternities of smooth, sharp perfection. We saw the stack of canned goods, and we tried to run to them. We fell in the snow, and we got up and went on, and Benny shoved us away and went at them, and pawed them and gummed them and gnawed at them, and he could not open them. AM had not given us a tool to open the cans. Benny grabbed a three quart can of guava shells, and began to batter it against the ice bank. The ice flew and shattered, but the can was merely dented, while we heard the laughter of a fat lady, high overhead and echoing down and down and down the tundra. Benny went completely mad with rage. He began throwing cans, as we all scrabbled about in the snow and ice trying to find a way to end the helpless agony of frustration. There was no way.\nThen Benny's mouth began to drool, and he flung himself on Gorrister \u2026 In that instant, I felt terribly calm. Surrounded by madness, surrounded by hunger, surrounded by everything but death, I knew death was our only way out. AM had kept us alive, but there was a way to defeat him. Not total defeat, but at least peace. I would settle for that. I had to do it quickly. Benny was eating Gorrister's face. Gorrister on his side, thrashing snow, Benny wrapped around him with powerful monkey legs crushing Gorrister's waist, his hands locked around Gorrister's head like a nutcracker, and his mouth ripping at the tender skin of Gorrister's cheek. Gorrister screamed with such jagged-edged violence that stalactites fell; they plunged down softly, erect in the receiving snowdrifts. Spears, hundreds of them, everywhere, protruding from the snow. Benny's head pulled back sharply, as something gave all at once, and a bleeding raw-white dripping of flesh hung from his teeth. Ellen's face, black against the white snow, dominoes in chalk dust. Nimdok, with no expression but eyes, all eyes. Gorrister, half-conscious. Benny, now an animal.\nI knew AM would let him play. Gorrister would not die, but Benny would fill his stomach. I turned half to my right and drew a huge ice-spear from the snow. All in an instant: I drove the great ice-point ahead of me like a battering ram, braced against my right thigh. It struck Benny on the right side, just under the rib cage, and drove upward through his stomach and broke inside him. He pitched forward and lay still. Gorrister lay on his back. I pulled another spear free and straddled him, still moving, driving the spear straight down through his throat. His eyes closed as the cold penetrated. Ellen must have realized what I had decided, even as fear gripped her. She ran at Nimdok with a short icicle, as he screamed, and into his mouth, and the force of her rush did the job. His head jerked sharply as if it had been nailed to the snow crust behind him. All in an instant. There was an eternity beat of soundless anticipation. I could hear AM draw in his breath. His toys had been taken from him. Three of them were dead, could not be revived. He could keep us alive, by his strength and talent, but he was not God.\nHe could not bring them back. Ellen looked at me, her ebony features stark against the snow that surrounded us. There was fear and pleading in her manner, the way she held herself ready. I knew we had only a heartbeat before AM would stop us. It struck her and she folded toward me, bleeding from the mouth. I could not read meaning into her expression, the pain had been too great, had contorted her face; but it might have been thank you. It's possible. Please. Some hundreds of years may have passed. I don't know. AM has been having fun for some time, accelerating and retarding my time sense. I will say the word now. Now. It took me ten months to say now. I don't know. I think it has been some hundreds of years. He was furious. He wouldn't let me bury them. It didn't matter. There was no way to dig up the deckplates.\nHe dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roared and sent locusts. It didn't do a thing; they stayed dead. I'd had him. He was furious. I had thought AM hated me before. I was wrong. It was not even a shadow of the hate he now slavered from every printed circuit. He made certain I would suffer eternally and could not do myself in. He left my mind intact. I can dream, I can wonder, I can lament. I remember all four of them. I wish\u2014 Well, it doesn't make any sense. I know I saved them, I know I saved them from what has happened to me, but still, I cannot forget killing them. Ellen's face. It isn't easy. Sometimes I want to, it doesn't matter. AM has altered me for his own peace of mind, I suppose. He doesn't want me to run at full speed into a computer bank and smash my skull. Or hold my breath till I faint. Or cut my throat on a rusted sheet of metal.\nThere are reflective surfaces down here. I will describe myself as I see myself: I am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled by fog where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were once my arms; bulks rounding down into legless humps of soft slippery matter. I leave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of diseased, evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within. Outwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been known as human, a thing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague resemblance. Inwardly: alone. Here. Living under the land, under the sea, in the belly of AM, whom we created because our time was badly spent and we must have known unconsciously that he could do it better.\nAt least the four of them are safe at last. AM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet \u2026 AM has won, simply \u2026 he has taken his revenge \u2026 I have no mouth. And I must scream.\n"

So listen as fast as you can.\nA friend of mine, when he was 13 years old he heard about \"pegging.\" This is when a guy gets banged\nup the butt with a dildo. Stimulate the prostate gland hard enough, and the rumor is you can have\nexplosive hands-free orgasms. At that age, this friend's a little sex maniac. He's always jonesing for a\nbetter way to get his rocks off. He goes out to buy a carrot and some petroleum jelly. To conduct a\nlittle private research. Then he pictures how it's going to look at the supermarket checkout counter, the\nlonely carrot and petroleum jelly rolling down the conveyer belt toward the grocery store cashier. All\nthe shoppers waiting in line, watching. Everyone seeing the big evening he has planned.\nSo my friend, he buys milk and eggs and sugar and a carrot, all the ingredients for a carrot cake. And\nVaseline.\nLike he's going home to stick a carrot cake up his butt.\nAt home, he whittles the carrot into a blunt tool. He slathers it with grease and grinds his ass down on\nit. Then, nothing. No orgasm. Nothing happens except it hurts.\nThen, this kid, his mom yells it's supper time. She says to come down, right now.\nHe works the carrot out and stashes the slippery, filthy thing in the dirty clothes under his bed.\nAfter dinner, he goes to find the carrot, and it's gone. All his dirty clothes, while he ate dinner, his mom\ngrabbed them all to do laundry. No way could she not find the carrot, carefully shaped with a paring\nknife from her kitchen, still shiny with lube and stinky.\nThis friend of mine, he waits months under a black cloud, waiting for his folks to confront him. And they\nnev\u00acer do. Ever. Even now that he's grown up, that invisible carrot hangs over every Christmas\ndinner, every birthday party. Every Easter egg hunt with his kids, his parents' grandkids, that ghost\ncarrot is hovering over all of them. That something too awful to name.\nPeople in France have a phrase: \"staircase wit.\" In French: esprit de l'escalier. It means that moment\nwhen you find the answer, but it's too late. Say you're at a par\u00acty and someone insults you. You have\nto say something. So under pressure, with everybody watching, you say something lame. But the\nmoment you leave the party....\nAs you start down the stairway, then-magic. You come up with the perfect thing you should've said.\nThe perfect crippling put-down.\nThat\u2019s the spirit of the stairway.\nThe trouble is, even the French don't have a phrase for the stupid things you actually do say under\npressure. Those stupid, desperate things you actually think or do.\nSome deeds are too low to even get a name. Too low to even get talked about.\nLooking back, kid-psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide\nwas kids trying to choke while they beat off. Their folks would find them, a towel twisted around their\nkid's neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. Dead sperm every\u00acwhere. Of\ncourse the folks cleaned up. They put some pants on their kid. They made it look ... better. Intentional\nat least. The regular kind of sad teen suicide.\nAnother friend of mine, a kid from school, his older brother in the Navy said how guys in the Middle\nEast jack off different than we do here. This brother was stationed in some camel country where the\npublic market sells what could be fancy letter openers. Each fancy tool is just a thin rod of pol\u00acished\nbrass or silver, maybe as long as your hand, with a big tip at one end, ei\u00acther a big metal ball or the\nkind of fan\u00accy carved handle you'd see on a sword. This Navy brother says how Arab guys get their\ndick hard and then insert this metal rod inside the whole length of their boner. They jack off with the\nrod inside, and it makes getting off so much better. More intense.\nIt's this big brother who travels around the world, sending back French phrases. Russian phrases.\nHelpful jack-off tips.\nAfter this, the little brother, one day he doesn't show up at school. That night, he calls to ask if I'll pick\nup his homework for the next couple weeks. Because he's in the hospital.\nHe's got to share a room with old people getting their guts worked on. He says how they all have to\nshare the same television. All he's got for privacy is a curtain. His folks don't come and visit. On the\nphone, he says how right now his folks could just kill his big brother in the Navy.\nOn the phone, the kid says how-the day before-he was just a little stoned. At home in his bedroom, he\nwas flopped on the bed. He was lighting a candle and flipping through some old porno magazines,\ngetting ready to beat off. This is after he's heard from his Navy brother. That helpful hint about how\nArabs beat off. The kid looks around for something that might do the job. A ballpoint pen's too big. A\npencil's too big and rough. But dripped down the side of the candle, there's a thin, smooth ridge of wax\nthat just might work. With just the tip of one finger, this kid snaps the long ridge of wax off the candle.\nHe rolls it smooth between the palms of his hands. Long and smooth and thin.\nStoned and horny, he slips it down inside, deeper and deeper into the piss slit of his boner. With a\ngood hank of the wax still poking out the top, he gets to work.\nEven now, he says those Arab guys are pretty damn smart. They've totally reinvented jacking off. Flat\non his back in bed, things are getting so good, this kid can't keep track of the wax. He's one good\nsqueeze from shooting his wad when the wax isn't sticking out anymore.\nThe thin wax rod, it's slipped inside. All the way inside. So deep inside he can't even feel the lump of it\ninside his piss tube.\nFrom downstairs, his mom shouts it's supper time. She says to come down, right now. This wax kid\nand the carrot kid are different people, but we all live pretty much the same life.\nIt's after dinner when the kid's guts start to hurt. It's wax, so he figured it would just melt inside him and\nhe'd pee it out. Now his back hurts. His kid\u00acneys. He can't stand straight.\nThis kid talking on the phone from his hospital bed, in the background you can hear bells ding, people\nscream\u00acing. Game shows.\nThe X-rays show the truth, some\u00acthing long and thin, bent double inside his bladder. This long, thin V\ninside him, it's collecting all the minerals in his piss. It's getting bigger and rougher, coated with\ncrystals of calci\u00acum, it's bumping around, ripping up the soft lining of his bladder, blocking his piss\nfrom getting out. His kidneys are backed up. What little that leaks out his dick is red with blood.\nThis kid and his folks, his whole fam\u00acily, them looking at the black X-ray with the doctor and the\nnurses stand\u00acing there, the big V of wax glowing white for everybody to see, he has to tell the truth.\nThe way Arabs get off. What his big brother wrote him from the Navy.\nOn the phone, right now, he starts to cry.\nThey paid for the bladder operation with his college fund. One stupid mis\u00actake, and now he'll never be\na lawyer.\nSticking stuff inside yourself. Stick\u00acing yourself inside stuff. A candle in your dick or your head in a\nnoose, we knew it was going to be big trouble.\nWhat got me in trouble, I called it Pearl Diving. This meant whacking off underwater, sitting on the\nbottom at the deep end of my parents' swimming pool. With one deep breath, I'd kick my way to the\nbottom and slip off my swim trucks. I'd sit down there for two, three, four minutes.\nJust from jacking oft' I had huge lung capacity. If I had the house to myself, I'd do this all afternoon.\nAfter I'd finally pump out my stuff, my sperm, it would hang there in big, fat, milky gobs.\nAfter that was more diving, to catch it all. To collect it and wipe each hand\u00acful in a towel. That's why it\nwas called Pearl Diving. Even with chlorine, there was my sister to worry about. Or, Christ almighty,\nmy mom.\nThat used to be my worst fear in the world: my teenage virgin sister, think\u00acing she's just getting fat,\nthen giving birth to a two-headed, retard baby. Both heads looking just like me. Me, the father and the\nuncle. In the end, it's never what you worry about that gets you.\nThe best part of Pearl Diving was the inlet port for the swimming pool filter and the circulation pump.\nThe best part was getting naked and sit\u00acting on it.\nAs the French would say, Who doesn't like getting their butt sucked? Still, one minute you're just a kid\ngetting off, and the next minute you'll never be a lawyer.\nOne minute I'm settling on the pool bottom and the sky is wavy, light blue through eight feet of water\nabove my head. The world is silent except for the heartbeat in my ears. My yellow\u00acstriped swim trunks\nare looped around my neck for safe keeping, just in case a friend, a neighbor, anybody shows up to\nask why I skipped foot\u00acball practice. The steady suck of the pool inlet hole is lapping at me and I'm\ngrinding my skinny white ass around on that feeling.\nOne minute I've got enough air and my dick's in my hand. My folks are gone at their work and my\nsister's got ballet. Nobody's supposed to be home for hours.\nMy hand brings me right to getting off, and I stop. I swim up to catch an\u00acother big breath. I dive down\nand settle on the bottom.\nI do this again and again.\nThis must be why girls want to sit on your face. The suction is like taking a dump that never ends. My\ndick hard and getting my butt eaten out, I do not need air. My heartbeat in my ears, I stay under until\nbright stars of light start worming around in my eyes. My legs straight out, the back of each knee\nrubbed raw against the concrete bot\u00actom. My toes are turning blue, my toes and fingers wrinkled from\nbeing so long in the water.\nAnd then I let it happen. The big white gobs start spouting. The pearls. It's then I need some air. But\nwhen I go to kick off against the bottom, I can't. I can't get my feet under me. My ass is stuck.\nEmergency paramedics will tell you that every year about 150 people get stuck this way, sucked by a\ncirculation pump. Get your long hair caught, or your ass, and you're going to drown. Every year, tons\nof people do. Most of them in Florida.\nPeople just don't talk about it. Not even French people talk about everything. Getting one knee up,\ngetting one foot tucked under me, I get to half standing when I feel the tug against my butt. Get\u00acting\nmy other foot under me, I kick off against the bottom. I'm kicking free, not touching the concrete, but\nnot getting to the air, either.\nStill kicking water, thrashing with both arms, I'm maybe halfway to the surface but not going higher.\nThe heartbeat in\u00acside my head getting loud and fast.\nThe bright sparks of light crossing and crisscrossing my eyes, I turn and look back ... but it doesn't\nmake sense. This thick rope, some kind of snake, blue\u00acwhite and braided with veins, has come up out\nof the pool drain and it's holding on to my butt. Some of the veins are leaking blood, red blood that\nlooks black underwater and drifts away from little rips in the pale skin of the snake. The blood trails\naway, disappearing in the water, and inside the snake's thin, blue\u00acwhite skin you can see lumps of\nsome half-digested meal.\nThat's the only way this makes sense. Some horrible sea monster, a sea serpent, something that's\nnever seen the light of day, it's been hiding in the dark bottom of the pool drain, waiting to eat me.\nSo ...I kick at it, at the slippery, rub\u00acbery knotted skin and veins of it, and more of it seems to pull out\nof the pool drain. It's maybe as long as my leg now, but still holding tight around my butt\u00achole. With\nanother kick, I'm an inch closer to getting another breath. Still feeling the snake tug at my ass, I'm an\ninch closer to my escape.\nKnotted inside the snake, you can see corn and peanuts. You can see a long bright-orange ball. It's\nthe kind of horse\u00acpill vitamin my dad makes me take, to help put on weight. To get a football\nscholarship. With extra iron and omega\u00acthree fatty acids.\nIt's seeing that vitamin pill that saves my life.\nIt's not a snake. It's my large intestine, my colon pulled out of me. What doctors call prolapsed. It's my\nguts sucked into the drain.\nParamedics will tell you a swimming pool pump pulls 80 gallons of water every minute. That's about\n400 pounds of pressure. The big problem is we're all connected together inside. Your ass is just the\nfar end of your mouth. If I let go, the pump keeps working-unravel\u00acing my insides-until it's got my\ntongue. Imagine taking a 400-pound shit and you can see how this might turn you inside out.\nWhat I can tell you is your guts don't feel much pain. Not the way your skin feels pain. The stuff you're\ndigesting, doctors call it fecal matter. Higher up is chyme, pockets of a thin, runny mess studded with\ncorn and peanuts and round green peas.\nThat's all this soup of blood and corn, shit and sperm and peanuts floating around me. Even with my\nguts unravel\u00acing out my ass, me holding on to what's left, even then my first want is to some\u00achow get\nmy swimsuit back on.\nGod forbid my folks see my dick.\nMy one hand holding a fist around my ass, my other hand snags my yellow\u00acstriped swim trunks and\npulls them from around my neck. Still, getting into them is impossible.\nYou want to feel your intestines, go buy a pack of those lambskin condoms. Take one out and unroll it.\nPack it with peanut butter. Smear it with petroleum jelly and hold it under water. Then try to tear it. Try\nto pull it in half. It's too tough and rubbery. It's so slimy you can't hold on.\nA lambskin condom, that's just plain old intestine.\nYou can see what I'm up against.\nYou let go for a second and you're gutted.\nYou swim for the surface, for a breath, and you're gutted.\nYou don't swim and you drown.\nIt's a choice between being dead right now or a minute from right now.\nWhat my folks will find after work is a big naked fetus, curled in on itself. Floating in the cloudy water of\ntheir backyard pool. Tethered to the bottom by a thick rope of veins and twisted guts. The opposite of\na kid hanging himself to death while he jacks off. This is the baby they brought home from the hospital\n13 years ago. Here's the kid they hoped would snag a football schol\u00acarship and get an MBA. Who'd\ncare for them in their old age. Here's all their hopes and dreams. Floating here, naked and dead. All\naround him, big milky pearls of wasted sperm.\nEither that or my folks will find me wrapped in a bloody towel, collapsed halfway from the pool to the\nkitchen tele\u00acphone, the ragged, torn scrap of my guts still hanging out the leg of my yellow\u00acstriped\nswim trunks.\nWhat even the French won't talk about.\nThat big brother in the Navy, he taught us one other good phrase. A Russian phrase. The way we say,\n\"I need that like I need a hole in my head...,\" Russian people say, \"I need that like I need teeth in my\nasshole......\nMne eto nado kak zuby v zadnitse.\nThose stories about how animals caught in a trap will chew off their leg, well, any coyote would tell you\na couple bites beats the hell out of being dead.\nHell ... even if you're Russian, someday you just might want those teeth.\nOtherwise, what you have to do is\u00acyou have to twist around. You hook one elbow behind your knee\nand pull that leg up into your face. You bite and snap at your own ass. You run out of air and you will\nchew through anything to get that next breath.\nIt's not something you want to tell a girl on the first date. Not if you expect a kiss good night. If I told\nyou how it tasted, you would never, ever again eat calamari.\nIt's hard to say what my parents were more disgusted by: how I'd got in trou\u00acble or how I'd saved\nmyself. After the hospital, my mom said, \"You didn't know what you were doing, honey. You were in\nshock.\" And she learned how to cook poached eggs.\nAll those people grossed out or feeling sorry for me....\nI need that like I need teeth in my asshole.\nNowadays, people always tell me I look too skinny. People at dinner parties get all quiet and pissed off\nwhen I don't eat the pot roast they cooked. Pot roast kills me. Baked ham. Anything that hangs around\ninside my guts for longer than a couple of hours, it comes out still food. Home-cooked lima beans or\nchunk light tuna fish, I'll stand up and find it still sitting there in the toilet.\nAfter you have a radical bowel resec\u00actioning, you don't digest meat so great. Most people, you have\nfive feet of large intestine. I'm lucky to have my six inch\u00aces. So I never got a football scholarship.\nNever got an MBA. Both my friends, the wax kid and the carrot kid, they grew up, got big, but I've\nnever weighed a pound more than I did that day when I was 13.\nAnother big problem was my folks paid a lot of good money for that swim\u00acming pool. In the end my\ndad just told the pool guy it was a dog. The family dog fell in and drowned. The dead body got pulled\ninto the pump. Even when the pool guy cracked open the filter casing and fished out a rubbery tube, a\nwatery hank of intestine with a big orange vita\u00acmin pill still inside, even then my dad just said, \"That\ndog was fucking nuts.\"\nEven from my upstairs bedroom window, you could hear my dad say, \"We couldn't trust that dog alone\nfor a second....\"\nThen my sister missed her period.\nEven after they changed the pool water, after they sold the house and we moved to another state,\nafter my sister's abortion, even then my folks never men\u00actioned it again.\nEver.\nThat is our invisible carrot.\nYou. Now you can take a good, deep breath.\nI still have not.\n"

                "content": "\n\nDuring these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished. It used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one's own management, but today that is quite impossible. We live in a different world now. At one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist; from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted; everybody wanted to see him at least once a day; there were people who bought season tickets for the last few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage; even in the nighttime there were visiting hours, when the whole effect was heightened by torch flares; on fine days the cage was set out in the open air, and then it was the children's special treat to see the hunger artist; for their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion, but the children stood openmouthed, holding each other's hands for greater security, marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights, with his ribs sticking out so prominently, not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground, sometimes giving a courteous nod, answering questions with a constrained smile, or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin it was, and then again withdrawing deep into himself, paying no attention to anyone or anything, not even to the all-important striking of the clock that was the only piece of furniture in his cage, but merely staring into vacancy with half-shut eyes, now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to moisten his lips.\nBesides casual onlookers there were also relays of permanent watchers selected by the public, ususally butchers, strangely enough, and it was their task to watch the hunger artist day and night, three of them at a time, in case he should have some secret recourse to nourishment. This was nothing but a formality, instituted to reassure the masses, for the initiates knew well enough that during his fast the artist would never in any circumstances, not even under forcible compulsion, swallow the smallest morsel of food; the honor of his profession forbade it. Not every watcher, of course, was capable of understanding this, there were often groups of night watchers who were very lax in carrying out their duties and deliberately hudled together in a retired corner to play cards with great absorption, obviously intending to give the hunger artist the chance of a little refreshment, which they supposed he could draw from some private hoard. Nothing annoyed the artist more than such watchers; they made him miserable; they made his fast seem unendurable; sometimes he mastered his feebleness sufficiently to sing during their watch for as long as he could keep going, to show them how unjust their suspicions were. But that was of little use; they only wondered at his cleverness in being able to fill his mouth even while singing. Much more to his taste were the watchers who sat up close to the bars, who were not content with the dim night lighting of the hall but focused him in the full glare of the electric pocket torch given them by the impresario. The harsh light did not trouble him at all, in any case he could never sleep properly,and he could always drowse a little, even when the hall was thronged with noisy onlookers. He was quite happy at the prospect of spending a sleepless night with such watchers; he was ready to exchange jokes with them, to tell them stories out of his nomadic life, anything at all to keep them awake and demonstrate to them that he had no eatables in his cage and that he was fasting as not one of them could fast. But his happiest moment was when the morning came and an enormous breakfast was brought them, at his expense, on which they flung themselves wit hthe keen appetite of healthy men after a weary night of wakefulness. Of course there were people who argued that this breakfast was an unfair attempt to bribe the watchers, but that was going rather too far, and when they were invited to take on a night's vigil without a breakfast, merely for the sake of the cause, they made themselves scarce, although they stuck stubbornly to their suspicions.\nSuch suspicions, anyhow, were a necessary accompaniment to the profession of fasting. No one could possibly watch the hunger artist continuosly, day and night, and so no one could produce first-hand evidence that the fast had really been rigorous and continuous; only the artist himself could know that, he was therefore bound to be the sole completely satisfied spectator of his own fast. Yet for other reasons he was never satisfied; it was not perhaps mere fasting that had brought him to such skeleton thinness that many people had regretfully to keep away from his exhibitions, because the sight of him was too much for them, perhaps it was dissatisfaction with himself that had worn him down. For he alone knew, what no other initiate knew, how easy it was to fast. It was the easiest thing in the world. He made no secret of this, yet people did not believe him. At the best they set him down as modest, most of them, however, thought he was out for publicity or else he was some kind of cheat who found it easy to fast because he had discovered a way of making it easy, and then had the impudence to admit the fact, more or less. He had to put up with all that, and in the course of time had got used to it, but his inner dissatisfaction always rankled, and never yet, after any term of fasting--this must be granted to his credit--had he left the cage of his own free will. The longest period of fasting was fixed by his impresario at forty days, beyond that term he was not allowed to go, not even in great cities, and there was good reason for it, too. Experience had proved that for about forty days the interest of the public could be stimulated by a steadily increasing pressure of advertisment, but after that the town began to lose interest, sympathetic support began notably to fall off, there were of course local variations as between one town and another, but as a general rule forty days marked the limit. So on the fortieth day the flower-bedecked cage was opened, enthusiastic spectators filled the hall, a military band played, two doctors entered the cage to measure the results of the fast, which were announced through a megaphone, and finally two young ladies appeared, blissful at having been selected for the honor, to help the hunger artist down the few steps leading to a small table on which was spread a carefully chosen invalid repast. And at this very moment the artist always turned stubborn. True, he would entrust his bony arms to the outstretched helping hands of the ladies bending over him, but stand up he would not. Why stop fasting at this particular moment, after forty days of it? He had held out for a long time, an illimitably long time; why stop now, when he was in his best fasting form, or rather, not yet quite in his best fasting form? Why should he be cheated of the fame he would get for fasting longer, for being not only the record hunger artist of all time, which presumably he was already, but for beating his own record by a performance beyond human imagination, since he felt that there were no limits to his capacity for fasting? His public pretended to admire him so much, why should it have so little patience with him; if he could endure fasting longer, why shouldn't the public endure it? Besides, he was tired, and now he was supposed to lift himself to his full height and go down to a meal the very thought of which gave him a nausea that only the presence of the ladies kept him from betraying, and even that with an effort. And he looked up into the eyes of the ladies who were apparently so friendly and in reality so cruel, and shook his head, which felt too heavy on its strengthless neck. But then there happened yet again what always happened. The impresario came forward, without a word--for the band made speech impossible--lifted his arms in the air above the artist, as if inviting Heaven to look down upon its creature here in the straw, this suffering martyr, which indeed he was, although in quite another sense; grasped him around the emaciated waist, with exaggerated caution, so that the frail condition he was in might be appreciated; and committed him to the care of the blenching ladies, not without secretly giving him a shaking so that his legs and body tottered and swayed. The artist now submitted completely; his head lolled on his breast as if it had landed there by chance; his body was hollowed out; his legs in a spasm of self-preservation clung to each other at the knees, yet scraped on the ground as if it were not really solid ground, as if they were only trying to find solid ground; and the whole weight of his body, a featherweight after all, relapsed onto one of the ladies, who looking round for help and panting a little--this post of honor was not at all what she expected it to be--first stretched her neck as far as she could to keep her face at least free from contact with the artist, then finding this impossible, and her more fortunate companion not coming to her aid, but merely holding extended on her own trembling hand the little bunch of knucklebones that was the artist's, to the great delight of the spectators burst into tears and had to be replaced by an attendant who had long been stationed in readiness. Then came the food, a little of which the impresario managed to get between the artist's lips, while he sat in a kind of half-fainting trance, to the accompaniment of cheerful patter designed to distract the public's attention from the artist's condition; after that, a toast was drunk to the public, supposedly prompted by a whisper from the artist in the impresario's ear; the band confirmed it with a mighty flourish, the spectators melted away, and no one had any cause to be dissatisfied with the proceedings, no one except the hunger artist himself, he only, as always.\nSo he lived for many years, with small regular intervals of recuperation, in visible glory, honored by all the world, yet in spite of that troubled in spirit, and all the more troubled because no one would take his trouble seriously. What comfort could he posibly need? What more could he possibly wish for? And if some good-natured person, feeling sorry for him, tried to console him by pointing out that his melancholy was probably caused by fasting, it could happen, especially when he had been fasting for some time, that he reacted with an outburst of fury and to the general alarm began to shake the bars of the cage like a wild animal. Yet the impresario had a way of punishing these outbreaks which he rather enjoyed putting into operation. He would apologize publicly for the artist's behavior, which was only to be excused, he admitted, because of the irritability caused by fasting; a condition hardly to be understood by well-fed people; then by natural transition he went on to mention the artist's equally incomprehensible boast that he could fast for much longer than he was doing; he praised the high ambition, the good will, the great self-denial undoubtedly implicit in such a statement; and then quite simply countered it by bringing out photographs, which were also on sale to the public, showing the artist on the fortieth day of a fast lying in bed almost dead from exhaustion. This perversion of the truth, familiar to the artist though it was, always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him. What was a consequence of the premature ending of his fast was here presented as the cause of it! To fight against this lack of understanding, against a whole world of non-understanding, was impossible. Time and time again in good faith he stood by the bars listening to the impresario, but as soon as the photographs appeared he always let go and sank with a groan back on to his straw, and the reassured public could once more come close and gaze at him.\nA few years later when the witnesses of such scenes called them to mind, they often failed to understand themselves at all. For meanwhile the aforementioned chance in public interest had set in; it seemed to happen almost overnight; there may have been profound causes for it, but who was going to bother about that; at any rate the pampered hunger artist suddenly found himself deserted one fine day by the amusement seekers, who went streaming past him to other more favored attractions. For the last time the impresario hurried him over half Europe to discover whether the old interest might still survive here and there; all in vain; everywhere, as if by secret agreement, a positive revulsion from professional fasting was in evidence. Of course it could not really have sprung up so suddenly as all that, and many premonitory symptoms which had not been sufficiently remarked or suppressed during the rush and glitter of success now came retrospectively to mind, but it was now too late to take any countermeasures. Fasting would surely come into fashion again at some future date, yet that was no comfort for those living in the present. What, then, was the hunger artist to do? He had been applauded by thousands in his time and could hardly come down to showing himself in a street booth at village fairs, and as for adopting another profession, he was not only too old for that but too fanatically devoted to fasting. So he took leave of the impresario, his partner in an unparalleled career, and hired himself to a large circus; in order to spare his own feelings he avoided reading the conditions of his contract.\nA large circus with its enormous traffic in replacing and recruiting men, animals and apparatus can always find a use for people at any time, even for a hunger artist, provided of course that he does not ask too much, and in this particular case anyhow it was not only the artist who was taken on but his famous and long-known name as well, indeed considering the peculiar nature of his performance, which was not impaired by advancing age, it could not be objected that here was an artist past his prime, no longer at the height of his professional skill, seeking a refuge in some quiet corner of a circus, on the contrary, the hunger artist averred that he could fast as well as ever, which was entirely credible, he even alleged that if he were allowed to fast as he liked, and this was at once promised him without more ado, he could astound the world by establishing a record never yet achieved, a statement which certainly provoked a smile among the other professionals, since it was left out of account the change in public opinion, which the hunger artist in his zeal conveniently forgot.\nHe had not, however, actually lost his sense of the real situation and took it as a matter of course that he and his cage should be stationed, not in the middle of the ring as a main attraction, but outside, near the animal cages, on a site that was after all easily accessible. Large and gaily painted placards made a frame for the cage and announced what was to be seen inside it. When the public came thronging out in the intervals to see the animals, they could harly avoid passing the hunger artist's cage and stopping there a moment, perhaps they might even have stayed longer had not those pressing behind them in the narrow gangway, who did not understand why they should be held up on their way towards the excitements of the menagerie, made it impossible for anyone to stand gazing quietly for any length of time. And that was the reason why the hunger artist, who had of course been looking forward to these visiting hours as the main achievement of his life, began instead to shrink from them. At first he could hardly wait for the intervals; it was exhilirating to watch the crowds come streaming his way, until only too soon--not even the most obstinante self-deception, clung to almost consciously, could hold out against the fact--the conviction was borne in upon him that these people, most of them, to judge from their actions, again and again, without exception, were all on their way to the menagerie. And the first sight of them from the distance remained the best. For when they reached his cage he was at once deafened by the storm of shouting and abuse that arose from the two contending factions, which renewed themselves continuously, of those who wanted to stop and stare at him--he soon began to dislike them more than the others--not out of real interest but only out of obstinante self-assertiveness, and those who wanted to go straight on to the animals. When the first great rush was past, the stragglers came along, and these, whom nothing could have prevented from stopping to look at him as long as they had breath, raced past with long strides, hardly even glancing at him, in their haste to get to the menagerie in time. And all too rarely did it happen that he had a stroke of luck, when some father of a family fetched up before him with his children, pointed a finger at the hunger artist and explained at length what the phenomenon meant, telling storied of earlier years when he himself had watched similar but much more thrilling performances, and the children, still rather uncomprehending, since neither inside nor outside school had they been sufficiently prepared for this lesson--what did they care about fasting?--yet showed by the brightness of their intent eyes that new and better times might be coming. Perhaps, said the hunger artist to himself many a time, things could be a little better if his cage were set not quite so near the menagerie. That made it too easy for people to make their choice, to say nothing of what he suffered from the stench of the menagerie, the animals' restlessness by night, the carrying past of raw lumps of flesh for the beasts of prey, the roaring at feeding times, which depressed him continuously. But he did not dare to lodge a complaint with the management; after all, he had the animals to thank for the troops of people who passed his cage, among whom there might always be one here and there to take an interest in him, and who could tell where they might seclude him if he called attention to his existence and thereby to the fact that, strictly speaking, he was only an impediment on the way to the menagerie.\nA small impediment, to be sure, one that grew steadily less. People grew familiar with the strange idea that they could be expected, in times like these, to take an interest in a hunger artist, and with this familiarity the verdict went out against him. He might fast as much as he could, and he did so; but nothing could save him now, people passed him by. Just try to explain to anyone the art of fasting! Anyone who has no feeling for it cannot be made to understand it. The fine placards grew dirty and illegible, they were torn down; the little notice board telling the number of fast days achieved, which at first was changed carefully every day, had long stayed at the same figure, for after the first few weeks even this small task seemed pointless to the staff; and so the artist simply fasted on and on, as he had once dreamed of doing, and it was no trouble to him, just as he had always foretold, but no one counted the days, not one, not even the artist himself, knew what records he was already breaking, and his heart grew heavy. And when once in a time some leisurely passer-by stopped, made merry over the old figure on the board and spoke of swindling, that was in its way the stupidest lie ever invented by indifference and inborn malice, since it was not the hunger artist who was cheating, he was working honestly, but the world who was cheating him of his reward.\nMany more days went by, however, and that too came to an end. An overseer's eye fell on the cage one day and he asked the attendants why this perfectly good cage should be left standing there unused with dirty straw inside it; nobody knew, until one man, helped out by the notice board, remembered about the hunger artist. They poked into the straw with sticks and found him in it. \"Are you still fasting?\" asked the overseer, \"when on earth do you mean to stop?\" \"Forgive me, everybody,\" whispered the hunger artist, only the overseer, who had his ear to the bars, understood him. \"Of course,\" said the overseer, and tapped his forehead with a finger to let the attendants know what state the man was in, \"we forgive you.\" \"I always wanted you to admire my fasting,\" said the hunger artist. \"We do admire it,\" said the overseer, affably. \"But you shouldn't admire it,\" said the hunger artist. \"Well then we don't admire it,\" said the overseer, \"but why shouldn't we admire it?\" \"Because I have to fast, I can't help it,\" said the hunger artist. \"What a fellow you are,\" said the overseer, \"and why can't you help it?\" \"Because,\" said the hunger artist, lifting his head a little and speaking, with his lips pursed, as if for a kiss, right into the overseer's ear, so that no syllable might be lost, \"because I couldn't find the food I liked. If I had found it, believe me, I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else.\" These were his last words, but in his dimming eyes remained the firm though no longer proud persuasion that he was continuing to fast.\n\"Well, clear this out now!\" said the overseer, and they buried the hunger artist, straw and all. Into the cage they put a young panther. Even the most insensitive felt it refreshing to see this wild creature leaping around the cage that had so long been dreary. The panther was all right. The food he liked was brought him without hesitation by the attendants; he seemed not even to miss his freedom; his noble body, furnished almost to the bursting point with all that it needed, seemed to carry freedom around with it too; somewhere in his jaws it seemed to lurk; and the joy of life streamed with such ardent passion from his throat that for the onlookers it was not easy to stand the shock of it. But they braced themselves, crowded round the cage, and did not want ever to move away.\n"
